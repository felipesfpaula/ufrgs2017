V<a href="http://forums.au.reachout.com/t5/user/viewprofilepage/user-id/3030">@blithe</a> when I'm not depressed I tend to feel invincible (super confident), more social, creative, energetic all the time etc. I can get on with my life and do a lot of things because I feel more active. But when I'm down I'm unmotivated, tired, absorbed in self hatred. My moods change for no apparent reason. I obviously do more things when I'm not depressed and I'm more involved in life because I feel up to it. <BR /><BR />I can try doing some relaxing things over the weekend like e.g. Walking, reading, praying etc. it may ease the feelings.

V1. My driving lesson went really well. Way better than I could imagine! I feel like I may actually be able to be confident in my own driving abilities before too long. <BR /><BR />2. I got some uni work done before the site started being glitchy. <BR /><BR />3. When I had a bit of a panic attack earlier my mother reacted pretty perfectly. (Calling work on my behalf, telling me it's okay and I don't need to have had a reason, getting me some water, asking if I wanted a hug, telling me it's okay to cry etc.) I'm not used to that.<BR /><BR />Extra:<BR />4. I was able to help relieve one of my best friends immediately when she needed it. <BR /><BR />5. A girl from a club that I haven't been to for a while but wanted to get back into called me today. I didn't pick up, but now I can get back into attending the club without my anxiety being so high about randomly disappearing/reappearing.

VHi everyone, thanks for all the advice. I'll have a read of that info too SophieRO. I had a good chat to my boss today about my stress level at work, she was very understanding and gave me some good advice to have a chat to my co worker. Long story short, I work in childcare and my assistant is not very helpful...this adds to my stress levels big time! I came home today and felt a bit more relaxed but tired...exhausted actually. I'm taking time off work at the end of the month for a few days so it will be nice to have a few days on my own. <BR />I think half my problem is that life gets stressful and I let it get to me, I never take time out for myself because there's always someone who wants me to take them somewhere or do stuff for them. I'm thankful I have no kids yet, I don't think I could cope!

I'll have to wait before I can try it but... I'm not sure how it is. Does it taste like vegemite? And have you tried melting it onto toast? IDEA!!!! You could melt the vegemite chocolate, spread it like nutella onto toast and you'd have chocolatey vegemite toast! Although I don't know what it tastes like, would that work?

V<P>&nbsp;</P>\u000a<P>In the last 6 months since completing my first year at university and basically failing my last semester I found myself not wanting to continue attending uni but needing a break thus going back to work and applying for a TAFE course closer to home. In this 6 months I felt pressured&nbsp;to keep up the university externally because thats what my family expected.</P>\u000a<P>Having TAFE fees to worry about every fortnight i have taken up 2 jobs and basically thrown university out of priority, but its always playing on my mind.</P>\u000a<P>&nbsp;I think i have taken too much on because nothing works, did it ever?&nbsp;</P>\u000a<P>My mother is a FIFO work on 4on/1off and since the beginning of the year I have seen her a total of 5 weeks as of this week, she is oblivious to what my life has become (everyone has) and spends the weeks home with a man who is still married to another when he feels like giving her attention or she spends it on her phone when i try my hardest to clear my week to spend some of the 6 days with her.&nbsp;</P>\u000a<P>Again..... i cant take days off work...i have to pay for TAFE....cant miss TAFE because maybe ill get a job from that later......oh just recieved another uni email *delete* ("maybe if i do that the assignment with disappear completely")</P>\u000a<P>When mum is away i live in a house alone (4 weeks) and many of it i find myself sobbing at the kitchen bench in my underwear thinking about what is going to happen when uni exam week comes along and how i have brought this on myself.</P>\u000a<P>I feel like its too late to try but if i dont im going to blow it completely and lose my place at the uni.</P>\u000a<P>&nbsp;</P>\u000a<P>For the last 6 months I have had no enthusiasm to try repeating the units i failed lastyear, All i want now is to move on with my degree but i dont think i can have any hope at that even at a different university, even in another years time....</P>\u000a<P>Theres so much pressure for me to make something of myself in order to support my sister whom has cerebral palsy once mum and dad are gone but i dont want to think about that either or how little time i spend with all three; mum, dad, my older sister.</P>\u000a<P>&nbsp;</P>\u000a<P>I dont want to think that my problem is that a big one but i just dont want to feel like this anymore, i dont want to keep this to myself anymore.</P>

My first year of uni was horrible- I felt like I was the only one alone and everyone</P>\u000a<P>else had friends and had met heaps of people. Its so easy to get into this victim thinking, &nbsp;where you think that no one wants to be your friend and that you are all alone. As hard as it is to do, I've found you have to realise at some point that thinking this way is not going to get you anywhere, its just going to keep you stuck where you are. I agree with the comment above- try out some new things, join some new clubs, or even just make an effort to eat in the uni cafeteria instead of in your car. Anything to get you out of the normal routine. Even you making the&nbsp;brave step to post on this forum is a step in the right direction!</P>\u000a<P>&nbsp;</P>\u000a<P>Sorry for the corny einstein quote, I had to <img class="emoticon emoticon-smileywink" id="smileywink" src="http://inspire.i.lithium.com/i/smilies/16x16_smiley-wink.png" alt="Smiley Wink" title="Smiley Wink" /></P>\u000a<P>&nbsp;</P>\u000a<DIV class="irc_mutc"><A class="irc_mutl" href="http://www.google.com.au/url?sa=i&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=images&amp;cd=&amp;cad=rja&amp;uact=8&amp;ved=0CAcQjRxqFQoTCJ6q7uTgwcUCFYcTpgod8VoAKw&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fquoteicons.com%2Feinstein-quotes%2Feinstein-quotes-14%2F4%2F&amp;ei=INtUVZ6aGoenmAXxtYHYAg&amp;bvm=bv.93112503,d.dGY&amp;psig=AFQjCNEmQ9uEi6c4n_z5wKzvc6ea5kkQpg&amp;ust=1431710872558591" data-ved="0CAcQjRxqFQoTCJ6q7uTgwcUCFYcTpgod8VoAKw" data-noload="" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><IMG style="margin-top: 0px;" class="irc_mut" src="https://encrypted-tbn3.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcTO_nqULP4CYhBIrdSAXNcZWKlB6MgSxwM-ZJrmVLTS09qFETal4Q" border="0" width="364" height="243" /></A></DIV>

Just remember that there are people who love you and care for you. Is there anyone you can go talk to ? any family or friends you'd feel comfortable contacting? <BR />I know it can be really frustrating when it feels like nothing is helping, but I urge you to keep trying. <BR />Maybe try a different counseller ? <BR />Just remeber Lifeline is there to call also if you want to call them.

VHey <a href="http://forums.au.reachout.com/t5/user/viewprofilepage/user-id/6875">@claret</a><BR /><BR />My mum had a similar problem with her dad, it was with cigarettes but she hated it when he smoked around us. <BR />I suggest checking out the link that Sophie provided, for help.<BR /><BR />You're definitely not overreacting, some people have different views and opinions on drugs and drug use and this is yours. If your husband is disgusted in himself for smoking in front of your child, then it shows that he might understand that you don't want it. Try to talk to him more, tell him why exactly you don't want it. Explain to him you don't mind it with his friends but near your children is a 'no no'. <BR />When you see it happening or after something has happened, ask him why he did. Find his reasoning. Your child is still young, so don't let him see you fighting, as my mum says, children are like sponges, they soak up everything around them. But also make sure they understand that they are not allowed to do it. <BR /><BR />You could also ask him to talk to other people about his addiction, to see if that can help him. <BR /><BR />Best of luck,<BR />N1ghtW1ng

It doesn't really matter that you didn't say one thing, because of all the stuff you have done, it's something to be proud of. And we are definitely all proud of you. <BR /><BR />I am proud of myself. I am surviving a 'teenage' life at the moment. Everything I'd imagine a teenage life was supposed to be like is what I'm experiencing right now. I am struggling, but I am still going and as tough as this is, I'm hoping I'll make it, of course I am but still, nope. I'm doing this. I will finish doing this. Because I am an awesome goddess from the world of Me. Nothing can change that.

VHey <a href="http://forums.au.reachout.com/t5/user/viewprofilepage/user-id/6833">@animallady</a> \u000aIf your husband doesn't take things seriously, still let him know. At least that you're having some trouble and apologise for any lashing out at him. This way, you have told him and he knows. \u000a\u000aI noticed that there wasn't any excerise on what you do. I think that excerise is a good way to release energy. This way, you might have less energy for hitting things. Going for a quick jog, walk, run. Doing some push ups, sit ups, jumps, just excerise of any kind to release energy. \u000aSomething else you could do is teach yourself how to punch properly. Practising stance, posture, energy, form. Good for self defense and release. Practising on soft items (pillows for example). ONLY on soft items can also help. It gives you something to it but won't hurt and will teach you something. \u000a\u000aSomething else I used to do was throw things around in my room. Soft things like my stuffed toys. I would also kick my bean bag around for a little while. It is exhausting trying to kick the bean bag around and doesn't hurt. \u000a\u000aAdding one new thing every day to your schedule can add something new. Pick up a new book to read and read a few chapters every day. Go out somewhere and read there instead of in your bedroom. Even go windowshopping if that's something you're into. \u000a\u000aThere are many things out there for you to try, it might take awhile but you'll find something.

Because so often my family doesn't get it right and the gifts, they remain unused. A waste of money, just sitting there. Sometimes handed down but otherwise just wasted. And I feel at fault because they were for me, I should be thankful that I'm even receiving anything but all I feel is guilt and annoyance because my family just doesn't get me. I feel jealous of my younger cousin and brother who get cool things, things I would like, and I get the things my other cousin or sister would like. It's not right, socially, to be feeling jealous, guilt and annoyance in a 'jolly' season where I should be grateful, happy and... sombre? Humble even? And the worst part is I can't reprociate their gifts. I can't buy something for someone else without help because I just don't know people, not very well at least. Which makes me feel more guilty because all I can do is try to look happy and smile and say thankyou. Like I'm supposed to. Ugh, I want to give my families gifts but I can't because I don't know how, how to buy something for them they'd want or how to give without worrying about what they think. Whether they'd think or say 'oh you shouldn't have!' It's meant pleasantly, oh you shouldn't have bought something for me, I don't need/want anything! But it doesn't feel like it, it feels like they are downplaying your gift, saying your gesture is wasted.&nbsp;</P>\u000a<P><STRONG>Pos:</STRONG>&nbsp;I am, obviously, way overthinking this. Your family, while completely messed up and slightly misunderstood, are slowly getting better. Their gifts are something you'd use. Not a selfish thought, but it means they are understanding you better and what I like, what I love. And I'm being a little silly saying jealousy isn't in the seasons. Of course it is, not a highly advertised part but as a growing teenage girl feeling misunderstood by her family it's totally acceptable to feel jealous of your male relatives getting stuff you'd be interested it. I'm sure plently of people would feel annoyed too, especially sibling rivalries, being generally annoyed with your family. And you are grateful, and if not happy, but appeased. I feel content with where I am, happy that I am with my family. And sure, I suck at gift giving but lots of people do. Only last year was my family close to accurate, giving my foriegn money and travel things in preparation for my journeys. While it also sucks people aren't always straight forward with what they want, I know what some of the people in my life like and enjoy. And that's okay. And the gesture isn't being downplayed by the phrase 'you shouldn't have'. Being honest I don't know what it means but I honestly don't remember encountering it myself and I doubt I will. It's just something I've read and seen/heard on the various things I've watched. Nothing to fear, and even if it does happen, tone and body language also mean a lot. The phrase itself seems somewhat harsh but with welcoming body language and a soft, happy tone it means something else.</P>\u000a<P>&nbsp;</P>\u000a<P><STRONG>Neg:</STRONG>&nbsp;People are hard to talk to. And I can't manage very well. At all.</P>\u000a<P><STRONG>Pos:</STRONG>&nbsp;Hahaha. I've created LIL for this, Laugh Inside Loudly, for those quiet moments when you are LOL but not making any sound (or even movement) to show laughter. Because I can assure myself that I have made at least two friends that I will hopefully stick with. Even more people that are more than aquantainces but I don't know if the word friend fits.&nbsp;</P>\u000a<P>&nbsp;</P>\u000a<P><STRONG>Neg:</STRONG>&nbsp;I'm absolutely terrible at making my own friends. Just look at my track record. My best friend from early age, our families have been friends for a long time. My school friends, my mum introduced me to them and then left me there. A friend I made on my own, gone. More friends I've tried to make are gone. Even on my trip it felt like a friend I've made wasn't really a friend, just circumstances left us to be 'friends'.&nbsp;</P>\u000a<P><STRONG>Pos:</STRONG>&nbsp;Hush darling, I would say to myself. I've changed a lot, still not the best judge of character but I'm getting better. And my friend who I sometimes feel like it a 'friend'. She's speaks another language natively, and she was with her other native friends. They are my friends too, but sometimes it can be difficult speaking another language and she just didn't want that. And we are in the same school and see each other a lot. I'm getting better at friend-making. And that's good.</P>\u000a<P>&nbsp;</P>\u000a<P><STRONG>Neg:</STRONG>&nbsp;Walk in to the restuarant near-first. Sit down at a lovely, and empty, (four person) table. Watch patiently as people move around you and sit at other tables. Feel your hope for friends dim, see&nbsp;your three friends sit somewhere else. Watch as the restuarant is almost full, your table still empty. Sigh deeply because you feel alone. Force a smile as late people are directed to your lovely and still empty table.&nbsp;</P>\u000a<P>Every. Bloody. Time.&nbsp;</P>\u000a<P><STRONG>Pos:</STRONG>&nbsp;Not always restuarants but it still hurts of course. But that's expected, I don't mind being by myself but alone... except I'm not alone, not really. I confessed to the people who sat down and they said, yeah it's the same with us. I couldn't help think that they still had each other while I was alone but, her meaning was clear, I'm not the only one it happens to.&nbsp;</P>\u000a<P><STRONG>More Pos:</STRONG>&nbsp;You don't call out to people, so they can always think the seats are taken. It didn't always happen and it also happened less towards the end. You even had an amazing friend who saw you by yourself and moved to sit with you so you weren't alone. This negative probably won't leave for awhile, maybe not at all. It'll happen occassionally but what's important, and what shines it out and throws it in that 'do not look, listen or touch' drawer is that you do have friends. People who will sit with you, or just general people who will if you encourage. I'm shy, reserved, people might think I want to be alone and leave it at that. I have friends who will sit with me and even if they don't, they're still willing another time.</P>\u000a<P>&nbsp;</P>\u000a<P><STRONG>Neg:</STRONG>&nbsp;It seems to be taking me forever to actually fall asleep, which is becoming increasingly annoying. My head won't stop running, it won't even quiet down, and I just toss and turn for close to an hour.</P>\u000a<P><STRONG>Pos:</STRONG>&nbsp;It's a pleasing feeling to wake up in the morning (except to alarms but we all know that feeling <img class="emoticon emoticon-smileyhappy" id="smileyhappy" src="http://inspire.i.lithium.com/i/smilies/16x16_smiley-happy.png" alt="Smiley Happy" title="Smiley Happy" />) knowing that I've fallen asleep. Even though I'm usually still tired.</P>\u000a<P>&nbsp;</P>\u000a<P>Just one more.... (this involves sexuality and sexual topics, if that makes you uncomfortable, you can skip over it. <img class="emoticon emoticon-smileyhappy" id="smileyhappy" src="http://inspire.i.lithium.com/i/smilies/16x16_smiley-happy.png" alt="Smiley Happy" title="Smiley Happy" />)</P>\u000a<P>&nbsp;</P>\u000a<P>&nbsp;</P>\u000a<P>&nbsp;</P>\u000a<P><STRONG>Neg:</STRONG>&nbsp;My head likes stories and sometimes these stories can be sexual. The problem is I am uncomfortable around those things and it just feels like I'm fighting against myself. My brain, thoughts and body are all fighting against each other and it's getting near too much.</P>\u000a<P><STRONG>Pos:</STRONG>&nbsp;I know where I stand and where my feelings sit on this particular topic. While your head might go a little too far and I'm left feeling uncomfortable it's okay because it will go away. It's alright to be confused but I know that I'm asexual. I know that I will never have sex. And I'm okay with it too.&nbsp;</P>\u000a<P>&nbsp;</P>\u000a<P>&nbsp;</P>\u000a<P>&nbsp;</P>\u000a<P>&nbsp;</P>\u000a<P>That's better. But now sleep and I'm sorry if refering to myself as 'you' got confusing. It's what I do when I pep-talk myself. <img class="emoticon emoticon-smileyhappy" id="smileyhappy" src="http://inspire.i.lithium.com/i/smilies/16x16_smiley-happy.png" alt="Smiley Happy" title="Smiley Happy" /></P>

V<P>It's been awhile but I need to get some stuff off my chest.</P>\u000a<P><STRONG>&nbsp;</STRONG></P>\u000a<P><STRONG>Neg:</STRONG><SPAN style="line-height: 15px;">&nbsp;My mental stories aren't always pleasant, but now they are even more linked to my real world and it's not good. Because a small part of me kind of wants it to happen, as terrible and disturbing as they are.</SPAN></P>\u000a<P><STRONG>Pos:</STRONG>&nbsp;That's all they are, stories. I'm a creative person, stories are my thing, daydreaming different things is something I enjoy and sadness, that's my element in stories. I know my way around it more or less, it's my stories focusing around what I'm good at writing about. And I love being in stories, which is why I want them to happen, because then the story would be real, and that would be cool to me. Not because what's happening but because it's a story become real.&nbsp;</P>\u000a<P>&nbsp;</P>\u000a<P><STRONG>Neg:</STRONG>&nbsp;I couldn't stop myself from freezing up around Jayden. Their presense and warm, cheerfulness just freaked me out. Some part of me feels that they were doing it intentionally, to get that uncomfortable feeling from me and that frozen state. I kept telling myself I wouldn't but each time I kept freezing up. Stupidly hopeless in the face of social interaction.</P>\u000a<P><STRONG>Pos:</STRONG>&nbsp;You've reached out to them, kind of, and are breaking down whatever it is that makes them in particular so uncomfortable. I think I know, I almost know, the reason why too. The opposite in personality social-wise. Their outgoingness and my ingoingness conflict so their direct openness to me just didn't work with my ingoingness so I froze.</P>\u000a<P>&nbsp;</P>\u000a<P><STRONG>Neg:</STRONG>&nbsp;My new family don't have the middle-ground so to speak. There's only yes or no and I can't handle that very well. It's hurting me emotionally because they'll ask me something "where do you want to eat?" and I might want nothing, maybe a cheap take out place or I could be in the mood for something fancy but my brain won't let me make that choice because I really don't mind, I don't want my decision to get in the way of what they'd rather do but they don't accept that. Same with choices, "rice or potato?" I can't choose, I might want potato but I'd be fine with rice if that's what they'd want but I'm in a position where my choice appears to be, the first one, in an unrealistic, broad way of putting it.&nbsp;</P>\u000a<P><STRONG>Pos:</STRONG>&nbsp;I really don't know about a positive for this. Where is the positive in being constantly indecisive in your head? I can't make proper decisions, I've rellied on my parents to do that instead, my friends. But that's a negative. The positive about this is that I know that I can give up what I want for a friend. I am happy letting them be happy, which makes us both happy. And I know that I'm not all that indecisive. I make the important choices, I make the minor choices and I choose which ones to let go for the sake of my friends and family. Because those choices aren't all that important in the long run and making sure my friends and family are happy is important. The important choices, those I know I will never change, but some can be simmered. And I know that as long as it doesn't make me too uncomfortable (because a little discomfort isn't a horribly bad thing because it could (and mostly is) related to being outside my comfort zone and I am somewhat happy to stretch it)) I am happy to do it.&nbsp;</P>\u000a<P>&nbsp;</P>\u000a<P><STRONG>Neg:</STRONG>&nbsp;I feel silly buying things for myself. I don't mind buying food for myself, or books for writing in, perhaps a pen or pencil if I'm feeling generous but 'gift' things? It feels selfish, wasting my money on those things. For example, on my trip around Europe I bought two decks of cards, two key chains and a sculpture for myself. (admittedly one keychain was for my brother but... don't tell him <img class="emoticon emoticon-smileyhappy" id="smileyhappy" src="http://inspire.i.lithium.com/i/smilies/16x16_smiley-happy.png" alt="Smiley Happy" title="Smiley Happy" />) But I feel guilty about wasting the money on those things. They are just possessions, I don't need them so why should I have them? Things are expensive, or even if they are cheap, that money could be put elsewhere. Schooling is expensive, food is expensive, housing is expensive. Everything is expensive but here I am wasting money on gifts that don't serve any purpose aside from hanging. The playing cards serve some purpose but I already have so many, why more? I'm not a collector exactly so, it feels like a waste. I try to be careful with money and other's money too. I feel immensly guilty when people buy things for me. Not so much around my birthday and christmas, because those are typically social gift-giving events but when it's something I won't use, it feels silly, there's another negative in here that I'll elaborate on in a sec or hundred but... money is precious, sort of and I feel like I'm wasting it.</P>\u000a<P><STRONG>Pos:</STRONG>&nbsp;Shush. I say just shush. It's okay to feel silly buying yourself things. But do you know what else you bought? A shirt, jewelry and magnets. And postcards. Not all of the things I've bought were for me. I'd done buying for people, and it was Italy! The playing cards had landmarks on them, some cool stuff so they were worth it. The keychains, you have a collection. And the sculpture, well that would make a good gift to someone anyway. I'm already so careful with my money, this is a near-once in this lifetime opportunity and it was okay to exploit it. It's okay to sometimes spend a little too much. I know that I have a steady amount safely tucked away for occassional use and money coming in monthly. I have a good bunch of coins lying around the place and probably some hidden notes. There is nothing to feel silly, or ashamed, of by buying yourself these things because you've deserved them. A little treat for yourself after such a long trip.&nbsp;</P>\u000a<P>&nbsp;</P>\u000a<P><STRONG>To be continued...</STRONG></P>

VHello, I am a 31 year old mother. I do not use drugs, I have not been abused. I am asking for opinions and advice on something that has been going on with me for a very long time.<BR />I work with people. I am very good at my job. Always happy, smiling and very patient.<BR />At home and with those I love, I am not the same. I have good days. Laughing, fishing, just being lazy. Most days are full of me yelling and hiding in my room.<BR />I have seen a doctor. They tried a few different medications for depression. None worked.<BR />I'm not really sure how to explain myself. The smallest things upset me and when asked why, I don't know. When something happens and I walk away to my room I just stare. There are no thoughts. Anything could trigger this, the door bells sound, someone's voice, bumping into me, just waking up.<BR />I find myself yelling more at my children or my tone is disapproving.<BR />I wonder how I know this behavior is happenening, yet, I can't fix it.<BR />Some days are crazy and I enjoy that nothing is going as planned. Most days I'm so frustrated because of the same.<BR />I shut everyone out. For days sometimes. And then I'm fine. But my family isnt. They are still wondering what happened. I know I've left out a lot. I just don't know how to explain this.<BR /><BR />Any replies are appreciated. Thank you

They think I am romantically and sexually repressed. But I've had relationships and crushes since the incident they are referring to. So confused. Especially when it came from someone I trust. Not at all what I was expecting.<BR /><BR />Just got to remember that only I can define my sexuality.

V<P><a href="http://forums.au.reachout.com/t5/user/viewprofilepage/user-id/6139">@safari93</a> sorry about my reply this morning... I'll start again.<BR /><BR /> I just wanted to say thank you, you're awesome, thanks for your kind words they really do mean heaps. I think what I'm failing to see is that I need to stop relying on professional counselling services to help me every time I'm struggling, when bad times hit me I need to to rely on my other coping strategies. Yeah sure, these services are struggling to meet the demand and it sucks because when my other supports (i.e. playing guitar) dont help me I'll need to ask them for help (i.e. eheadspace, khl) and there are also thousands of other people needing help they can't get from these places. It's unfortunate but its not all about me... and these services aren't equipped to be helping me every night that i need it, I need to be using the resources and my survival kit to help me. How they have been treating me by giving me the run around isn't fair but what I can I do?I've written a complaint to both services. I've tried my best with them to get help but now it's time to use those services appropriately and only if my other resources, like things from my survival kit, don't help me. I've got my letter drafted and ready to type up. Hopefully by me not reaching out to each of these when I need them next and instead using what I have on me to help myself first, someone who has never gotten professional help has the opportunity to.</P>

Despite my help, she posted in our facebook group asking for help. I felt kinda stupid for even trying, when it didn't feel like she was really listening to me.</P>\u000a<P>Pos: I tried.

After looking at my phone the nerves just became more intense. Reading the email, initially, was kinda hard. Yet now it doesn't have that strong emotional response. Why do I get such a strong emotional response when I get such emails? Why do I start to fret every time my phone goes off?</P>\u000a<P>Pos: Said email was Eheadspace letting me know they got in touch with the psych today. Hopefully it will make the initial apt a little easier. I know the emotional response is a sense of anxiety with not knowing why or who is trying to contact me. It's managable at least</P>\u000a<P>&nbsp;</P>\u000a<P>Neg: Part of me feels even more nervous to see the psych next week now that she knows a bit about me and some of what I've been going through.&nbsp;</P>\u000a<P>Pos: I got Eheadspace to do this to help me, so I wouldn't have to start from ground 0. I will get through it.</P>

V<P>We made a math test earlier today and during the test I couldn't help but break down, I started crying and I started getting all these emotions. Like usual I failed the test. I managed to do like 5 questions out of the 30. And then during the test I just wanted to die... I'm not sure what I'm trying to look for. This is the second time i've cried during a math test. In a way, it gets to me and it effects me so much that something like a math test can trigger all these feelings. &nbsp;</P>\u000a<P>&nbsp;</P>\u000a<P>During one of the classes there is a guy that has a problem. I'm not sure what problem he has and I don't want to be nosey. But my friend started critiziing him saying he acts like he has aa problem and it annoyed me so much when she said that, because I think i'm starting to get problems.&nbsp;</P>\u000a<P>&nbsp;</P>\u000a<P>I'm started to get breakdowns during the night, and just get into crying. And i can notice that me and my parent's aren't that close anymore because I get very moody and angry at what they do and I guess im just mad that they don't get my side of the story. And they don't get what I'm going though but at the same time its my fault for not telling them.&nbsp;</P>\u000a<P>&nbsp;</P>\u000a<P>I think I just wanted someone to talk to.

VThanks <a href="http://forums.au.reachout.com/t5/user/viewprofilepage/user-id/1388">@Myvo</a> <a href="http://forums.au.reachout.com/t5/user/viewprofilepage/user-id/5937">@lanejane</a> I'm away at the moment so I'm using to sort of think about what and how I'm going to help him, while keeping my wellbeing in mind of course. It's a bit stressful because he almost relies on me for everything and even thinks that if he tells me about failing school subjects or whatever, that I won't care and it'll be fine... but it's totally not and not ok to show up to my house when I'm not even home and help himself to using my stuff. I understand everything is sort of messed up for him at home and stuff but he's going to get himself into so much trouble if he keeps doing what he is doing. I don't want to be that person that ecourages it or says it ok, I'm 5 years older than him and feel pretty much responsible for him so I have to do something...<BR />I never had anyone when I was that age, I just figured out what was ok and what wasn't, but some people don't pick it up themselves.

VI don't think so, wasn't a huge deal, but it was a mistake I made but chose not to take the blame for it. This person is now on 2 weeks holidays so I don't have to worry about them remembering the issue and worrying about if they now don't think I'm a good worker or something. Unless they've gone to my boss, there isn't much I can do - I know they have gone to everybody else about the problem though - which is making me feel really down because they must think bad of me. If I go to my boss and they know nothing, he'll find out I did something stupid, and what do I say if I do go to him and he knows - say i lied "yeah... so i didnt want to get in trouble so i talked bullshit, but I'm telling you now instead" I'm such an idiot.

VHey <a href="http://forums.au.reachout.com/t5/user/viewprofilepage/user-id/5111">@j95</a><BR /><BR />In my experience one of the best ways to be a role model for younger siblings is by trying your best in your own life. This doesn't mean not making any mistakes, but constantly trying and finding a way to get by despite anything you've done. Most of my older siblings have at some point either completely backflipped on life or gotten onto a completely wrong track, but I'm inspired by the way they turn themselves around and into something that will make them happy. <BR /><BR />My best friend sees his older brother as a role model largely for a similar reason - his brother seems successful and most importantly happy. <BR /><BR />Another really big aspect of seeing siblings as role models is them feeling like they're on your side or are a friend. The easiest way to do this is probably to take interest in them. So ask him about whatever you know is going on in his life and get involved if you can. Watch a show with him so that it feels like that's the show that belongs to the two of you, or introduce him to some of your favourite bands.<BR />For me and my friends, whenever our older siblings have shared that sort of stuff with us it immediately become somewhat special.<BR /><BR />There's one last one and it fits in really well to the above two: Help him. Offer to help him with his school work or find a tutor. Help him learn about taking care of himself, for me one way one of my sisters did this that was wonderful was by always making me do a lot of the cooking when I was with her. <BR />The headspace idea goes into this really well.<BR /><BR />Doing any of these things would be wonderful. That you want to help him out and that he does come to you already means that you're doing something right.

But I've never felt able to share the struggles I've faced over the years, so it goes hand in hand I guess.<BR />Yes and no. I don't want to be the subject of town gossip. Not that my mum gossips much, but those she talks to and uses as part of her support do. I feel like telling her will then be told to people around us that I don't want to know. I just want to get better and have only the people I feel ok with knowing. I know I'm trying to control it too much, but I feel safer that way. And yes I'm very scare how she might react. It's what has kept me sharing a lot of things for quite some time. When it all first started several years ago, I kinda just thought that if I told her, she'd blame herself for not picking it up, for not acting on it. So I've hid it ever since. But that was just one influencing factor. There's quite a few others which I've been able to identify.<BR />I guess I just don't want to make a big scene out of it...

I've got two tasks she wants me to do each day, and I've said I will. I've done one today. But I just don't know where to turn now. I'm just feeling so numb. Still so anxious. I'm shaking and have no clue why.<BR /><BR />That makes sense. I was going to write about things I needed to share, but I never felt ok enough to do so, and only remembered late last night, and decided sleep was more important. I even forgot my journal which I was going to shove in my bag... <BR /><BR />Why does it feel so much easier to put myself down than build myself up?<BR /><BR />How did you know when the best time was to share those things? Was it because of your relationship with the counsellor, or something inside you?

By measuring how bad things are? People than say that is not always bad, it can be good aswell.Well i didn't &nbsp;believe them so i did some science.I've been doing this experiment for so long now, and i always get the same result:Reality is a measure of how bad things are, and it has a tendency to get worse.</P>\u000a<P>But people are persistent....no no no you're wrong there is something wrong with your experiments.Then, i asked myself, maybe you are the problem,experiment is not valid if you use faulty measurement gear.So whats faulty here? Is it the people and the whole world, or is it just me........ITS THE WORLD i shouted loudly and laughed....</P>\u000a<P>So i made a list:-</P>\u000a<P>Social life: none,</P>\u000a<P>Job:none,</P>\u000a<P>Wealth:none</P>\u000a<P>Intelligence:I cant test myself,well i did some IQ test but they are so unreliable its pitiful...</P>\u000a<P><SPAN>Appearence:Atleast its not "NONE" hahah</SPAN></P>\u000a<P><SPAN>So see my problem here? Its not some faulty part here, the whole measurement apparatus is broken.You cant fix it, if you partially fix some parts,the others get worse, so back to square one.</SPAN></P>\u000a<P><SPAN>But then again is it really broken or people are lying, in fact they are broken..................</SPAN></P>\u000a<P><SPAN>&nbsp;</SPAN></P>\u000a<P><SPAN>ArgghHHhhh crap what did i just wrote maybe i really am retarded.</SPAN></P>

VSophie, you could not be further from the truth. The reason I am bothered by this is because some person conducted research on the matter and since I place weight in science I grew afraid. Scared that it would be pointless to build anything with someone if I would inevitably turn straight. That's what it's about, fear. If anything that deep down would be gay, since while I become aware of it when I was 13 I had some fairly erotic I guess dreams regarding men before that. I'm 23 now so this has been going for quite a while and I had no doubts. <BR /><BR />But then again I did always have a hatred for the gay community and never felt accepted in it.

V<P><SPAN>Not really sure how to phrase the title but this is the closest I can get to.</SPAN><BR /><BR /><SPAN>Simply put I read an article that made it seem as though being gay was not a permanent state. It mentioned something regarding sexual fluidity and something about 10 percent of each gender is fluid. This of course pretty much sent my head into a tail spin. </SPAN><BR /><BR /><SPAN>Mind you, before all of this happened I had no doubts about being attracted sexually and romantically to guys. I really only liked women as friends and I had a thing for seeing strong women in the media and such, but it was more of an admiration/ hero sort of thing. Now I'm doubting myself where none existed before. It's made my adoration for these women seem like something sexual and now my attraction towards men has dropped. It's almost like my brain is trying to prepare itself for some sort of eventuality where I turn straight or don't like men anymore. It's made it hard to deal with people and of course dealing with my boyfriend. </SPAN><BR /><BR /><SPAN>I know it's not a big chance, but the thought of just changing one day without any control on my part is scary. Especially when I spent a good deal of time coming to terms with being gay, now there is this possibility to be afraid of. I wish there was a way to know for certain if it happens but there is none. It's makes me wonder how real my affections were for men in the past, even now this attitude towards women almost feels forced and unnatural, while thinking about men just feels so right.</SPAN><BR /><BR /><SPAN>I wish I knew how to dea with these thoughts running about in my head.</SPAN></P>

And I'm glad that the other site has given you some advice that you can use. <BR /><BR />What you are saying is that this article uses science to say you being g is only a phase. And because the article uses science and research, it means that this could happen to you. <BR /><BR />I apologise for seeming like I was assuming it was already there, what I meant with what I was saying was, while your feelings might fluctuate at times, it does not undermine your sexuality. So you might, once, feel attraction to a woman however this would be to someone you already admire or feel strongly(platonically) about. <BR /><BR />Have you read any other articles about this topic? Are there any others that can help you relieve this fear or is it already relieved?

I haven't used eheadspacce or headspace for anything other than medical issues so I can't really comment. <BR />I have found lifeline really helpful, but the thing about them is you have no idea who you speak to so it makes it hard for any ongoing support, but really great in crisis<BR /><BR />I hope that helps

Im still in the process of deciding weather I want to do chemo or if I want to leave it and just live my life with the time that I have left. But with each day going by there is a risk of the cancer soreading to other parts of my body, an i dont what that to happen but this isnt a decison I can make lightly, I really need to decide what Is best for me, but i dont know what that is. Im so scared that if I do this chemo it might not work either, i am scared to tell my mum becasue i dont know what she will do or say, i cant go and talk to my cousin about it as she still isnt speaking to me and wont talk to me anytime soon by the looks of things.&nbsp;</P>\u000a<P>i JUST DONT KNOW WHAT TO DO!!&nbsp;</P>\u000a<P>why does life have to be so god dmn hard,&nbsp;</P>\u000a<P>&nbsp;</P>\u000a<P>these last few days have been difficult with it being the anniversary of my grandfathers death 1 year without him has been extremely hard and i just want things to end!&nbsp;</P>

VHey <a href="http://forums.au.reachout.com/t5/user/viewprofilepage/user-id/6866">@Bed_Head</a><BR /><BR />You have a lot going on around you. It sounds like you don't want to be doing the university course and you're instead only doing it for your family? If this is the case I really want you to consider dropping it or at least deferring to see if having it taken away helps you. Right now it may not be much of a priority for you but it is certainly adding stress. A family may want what's best, but that doesn't mean that they know what's best. <BR />You can be more successful through TAFE than uni. And right now it certainly sounds like you may be happier through TAFE than uni. <BR /><BR />Even if you left, it is never too late for uni. You can always go back, it may not be the exact same path as before (though sometimes it will pretty much be) but there's still a way back.<BR /><BR />Are there any fee help services the government offers that could help with your TAFE fees?

VYes, he judged our positions from the last time we played in district trials. I played against the top seed where I gave him a very good fight but lost in a tight battle. I had to play the other guy in the consolation round. I had only 10 minutes to rest from a very tiring match and I ended up losing because I was so exhausted. If you know tennis, you have probably heard of the of the term pushing, where all he did was hit high lobs over me of which I was too tired to do anything. I played him 2 times after that and beat him both times, but when I told my teacher, he said he didn't want to hear it. The worst part is how I never got any credit for my efforts against the top seed in the trials. I'm still thinking about it now and I have no one to talk to.

I guess its also to do with the fact, I've been in treatment in the past, I can't help wonder did it not work because its wasn't right for me? Or was it because I didn't put myself into it.

Say that you are feeling anxious about the ceremony? <BR /><BR />But the first thing to do it find out if it's compulsory. Then go from there.

V<P>Hello everyone, I've been struggling lately with being pretty down about being practically unemployed, by that I mean I'm employed as a casual and have only ever had casual work and I'm 25 now. I feel like a bludger/failure because I don't work fulltime when my partner does at least 45 hours a week. How can I stop feeling like this? I hardly feel like getting out of bed <img class="emoticon emoticon-smileysad" id="smileysad" src="http://inspire.i.lithium.com/i/smilies/16x16_smiley-sad.png" alt="Smiley Sad" title="Smiley Sad" /> is this a common thing for people to get upset about?&nbsp;</P>

You've taken a very positive step by joining Reach Out and talking about how you're feeling. <BR /><BR />It's important to give yourself time and space to grieve, so you can process everything that's happened. Sharing your feelings with friends and family can really help you get through this period. <BR /><BR />Speaking to a grief counsellor is another really positive way to help process the feelings you're having at the moment.<BR /><BR />It sounds like you care about this girl a great deal, do you think there's a possibility you could both remain good friends some time in the future?

VHey <a href="http://forums.au.reachout.com/t5/user/viewprofilepage/user-id/6746">@past_future</a> I saw your post on Sat and have been meaning to reply, but things have been pretty hectic for me. Congrats again on seeing your gp! I know firsthand how scary that is. It was similar for me too, the GP didn\u2019t say \u201cyou\u2019ve got ___\u201d or \u201cYou\u2019re ____\u201d but instead she focused more on the feelings I was having and how I felt, which for me was enough. It was all I would have been able to cope with too! Also if you aren't happy with their response you can always try another gp, I know this will be hard, but it may be worth having  someone more empathetic. <BR /><BR />I totally understand your fears with not having someone check up on you, I\u2019m new to this all to, but maybe this is something you can bring up with whoever you decide to see? So they\u2019re aware?<BR /><BR />You asked for experiences with counselors, thus far my experience with Eheadspace has been amazing, and they've helped me move into face to face counselling so much. When I hadn't contacted them in a while they sent me an email asking how things were going. Our main goal was to get me into face to face support. Eheadspace has honestly been a huge help for me, and why I've tried so hard to get into face to face support, despite the troubles I've had...<BR /><BR />I've also had good experiences with Kids Help Line. I was in contact very regularly for about 3-4 years, and slowly disappeared due to heavy study load and I felt they were pushing me too much into phone counselling, which I wasn't ready for...<BR /><BR />In my experiences with these services, I'd also say yes the fear and struggle is worth it. Long term more so like Birdeye was saying in their post, but I found short term so many times I'd walk away feeling listened to, like someone cared - supported.<BR /><BR /><a href="http://forums.au.reachout.com/t5/user/viewprofilepage/user-id/214">@Birdeye</a> Such detailed explanations! Thank you, this has helped me aswell! <img class="emoticon emoticon-smileyhappy" id="smileyhappy" src="http://inspire.i.lithium.com/i/smilies/16x16_smiley-happy.png" alt="Smiley Happy" title="Smiley Happy" /><BR /><BR />I hope this has helped past_future <img class="emoticon emoticon-smileyhappy" id="smileyhappy" src="http://inspire.i.lithium.com/i/smilies/16x16_smiley-happy.png" alt="Smiley Happy" title="Smiley Happy" />

"why is part of me not good enough" going on ... i feel like theres something wrong with me and i dont like that .. im scared about going to see a psycholiogist and telling them all of my problems, pouring my heart out,&nbsp;for it to not work out .. im just going to feel stupid you know ...&nbsp;<BR /><BR />will a psychologist be able to give me a diagnosis or on a psychiatrist? I was told by the dr that there isnt a psychiatrist in my area will the psychologist do?&nbsp;<BR /><BR />thank you so much for the help, means a lot x</P>

It feels like too much.<BR />My teacher said she spoke with the psych, but I don't know anything more. I'll have to wait until my next apt. to find out.<BR /><BR />Work is stressful. The having to be 100% awesome all the time. The awkwardness when I can't understand a customer, because I wasn't listening. The awkwardness of no conversation, or my failed attempts at conversation... Then there is the rush, sometimes I just can't cope, or the dead quiet time and there's nothing I can do because someone needs to stay on registers... blergh. And then there are the thoughts in my head making it all 10 times harder. <img class="emoticon emoticon-smileysad" id="smileysad" src="http://inspire.i.lithium.com/i/smilies/16x16_smiley-sad.png" alt="Smiley Sad" title="Smiley Sad" /> I just wan to scream!<BR /><BR />But it all feels like nothing moonwalk, because despite it all, I'm worse. The suicidal thoughts have increased, these dark times are becoming longer, more intense and more frequent. I'm feeling over fighting myself. I'm too tired to fight much more. And everything is just wearing me thin. I don't know how much more I can actually cope with.<BR /><BR />I have an appointment with the psych on Thursday, but I'm seriously wishing I booked it for Tuesday instead <img class="emoticon emoticon-smileysad" id="smileysad" src="http://inspire.i.lithium.com/i/smilies/16x16_smiley-sad.png" alt="Smiley Sad" title="Smiley Sad" />

V<P>Thanks a lot. I agree I'm being incredibly brave - I've never really found it at all difficult to talk about what is troubling me. Not at all. It's a great skll I possess. I don't think anyone should be afraid to speak up - but unfortunately it isn't always that easy. I can totally understand that.&nbsp;<BR /><BR />This weekend I am feeling quite good. Definitely an improvement that's for sure,&nbsp;<BR />To answer your other question - sometimes talking to people online helps relieve the stress. But definitely not always.&nbsp;<BR /><BR />I certainly do respect my friend very very very much - and I would be willing to do anything so as to maintain our friendship and make her as happy as possible. And I think I do a fantastic job of that. In fact, I caught up with her yesterday (even though it wasn't for long at all) and had a small talk about things. But it sucked we only spoke for about 50 minutes. We didn't get the chance for both of us to really talk about everything that has been going on for both of us. You know what I mean? When you catch up with friends who are particularly close, you want to be able to sit down for 3-4 hours and discuss all the things that have been going on for you; if you had any particular upsets since last catching up, what happened, how you dealt with it. How your friends family is doing and what they are getting up to, how your friends work is going, and if anything of note happened that they would like to discuss. A complete debrief you know! But that's just my opinion. It depends on the friend in question, I have friends that I don't talk about my person life to at all, and neither do they for whatever reason.&nbsp;<BR />Regardless of us not doing any of that, I'm not going to dwell on it and be complacent, that will only make me more upset. I'm fine with it - and I'm grateful we caught up at all you know?&nbsp;<img class="emoticon emoticon-smileyvery-happy" id="smileyvery-happy" src="http://inspire.i.lithium.com/i/smilies/16x16_smiley-very-happy.png" alt="Smiley Very Happy" title="Smiley Very Happy" /><BR /><BR />Being at home is an amazing thing, I'm not sure about you - but I live alone. There's nothing inherently wrong with it, but it just does get lonely at times. It would be like that for most people I would imagine.&nbsp;<BR />Considering the torment and problems I had when living with my parents over two years ago, the fact that I am living on my own now completely free of any emotional abuse whatsoever. It's a truly magnificent thing - trust me! It's an enormous blessing and I am very very grateful. As you say the outside world&nbsp;<EM>can&nbsp;</EM>be dangerous - it depends upon if we reinforce the meaning of it. I just need to reinforce the fact that it is an okay thing, there is nothing terrible about it. I need to develop some new coping strategies to sort it out. I have every confidence I will.&nbsp;<BR />Personally though, I love going out and about. I love being in certain places. I love being in the city, but not when my anxiety decides to play up on its own accord. That simply does not help. It's like it has a mind of its own.&nbsp;<BR /><BR />Funny you should mention it, I did speak to an online counsellor. But that didn't help at all. I just constantly had this sense (or a little person on my shoulder telling me) that they weren't listening to me and didn't really care at all. So I don't think I'll be going back to that any time soon. But that's fine, I'm doing pretty good. I'll talk to them again if I feel lonely. Maybe...&nbsp;</P>

V<a href="http://forums.au.reachout.com/t5/user/viewprofilepage/user-id/5937">@lanejane</a>- My mum has sooo much going on at the moment she is stressing enough. My older brother has gone crazy and she is really worried about him, so I dont want to add to the pressure she is already under with my brother. I hate watching my mum struggle and if i can do anything to help her it would be to keep some things to myself. I know its the wrong thing to do but that all i feel i can do right now. <BR />I spoke to my doctor and said for now i want to put a hold on treatment. <BR />I will try the pros and cons list. <BR /><BR /><a href="http://forums.au.reachout.com/t5/user/viewprofilepage/user-id/6087">@tsnyder</a>- they are my decisions but i always seem to make the wrong ones lately and im scared like crazy. Usually i have my cousin to help me with this stuff and these decisions but she wont speak to me. <BR />Umm well i was not long ago in training to play soccer professionally but that can't happen any more. <BR />My emotions change one moment i can be happy and the next i could be crying just wishing i could go to sleep and this will all be over. I have my good days and bad days.. <BR />I just hate this soooo much

Vi think when I'm depressed it I tend hurt me over the past a lot. After depression hits I start ruminating intensely and i spiral further down. <BR /><BR />I feel like I'm to blame, for showing weakness. I feel by showing weakness, others know where to hit me. Some things I can talk about, some things I can't.

VHi there,<BR /><BR />Everyone else has provided great advice that I won't repeat right now, I just wanted to say a couple of things about your latest post.<BR /><BR />It makes complete sense for you to get anxious when you're doing something you don't like. And it's completely fair to want to not do hospitality roles. <BR />I don't know much about transfers and job providers, but I know that's horrible to be made to feel bad about trying to do something that is best for you (and best for them too really since they should want employees that will thrive in their jobs, rather than ones who they're placing in the wrong ones). Please don't let that defer you from seeking a transfer (or searching for a new job). You have to do what's best for your wellbeing.

V<P>Hey,<BR /><BR />I want to throw in a couple of other things to consider since you seem very torn about whether to leave or stay:</P>\u000a<P><BR />1. Maybe you don't need to make a drastic move out of state? Perhaps just to a different place in Melbourne. Melbourne is a very big place and in my experience people don't explore beyond their general area and the city all that much. Or even to a place like Geelong or somewhere a bit more country that may be further or closer away. <BR /><BR />2. Perhaps you need a holiday/break for a little while? Could you go somewhere for even a few days or a week? That could give you a sense of whether being away feels any different. <BR /><BR />3. (Greatly related to the last point) Moving away doesn't mean you can't come back. If you find after a couple of months that you're feeling worse, you do not have to stay there. You can move again, or you can move back to Melbourne.</P>

VHey <a href="http://forums.au.reachout.com/t5/user/viewprofilepage/user-id/6746">@past_future</a> I'm sorry, it must feel awful to have had such an experience. Although as birdeye was saying he probably doesn't have the training or knowledge about mental health issues to give you a proper diagnosis.<BR />I have, I managed to answer a call last week from someone local, and have my first apt with a psychologist next Monday. <BR />I'm glad you managed to contact Eheadspace! It's really good to hear you're wanting advice on a next step. The awesome part about turning to them, is that it puts you in touch with someone trained in mental health, to help you figure out your path t your pace. <img class="emoticon emoticon-smileyhappy" id="smileyhappy" src="http://inspire.i.lithium.com/i/smilies/16x16_smiley-happy.png" alt="Smiley Happy" title="Smiley Happy" />

V<P>@moonwalk&nbsp;Assessments have really been stressing me out recently, it's definitely not helped my health one bit!</P>\u000a<P>I've been trying to just focus on one thing at a time with them, and moving on when I'm getting too flusted, I'm not sure how well it's working tho...<BR />I spoke with the psych last week, and the first apt time she had was next Monday on the 11th, otherwise it'd clash with work or TAFE which we decided not to do. So it's a whole-nother week I've got to wait to see her!</P>\u000a<P>&nbsp;</P>\u000a<P><SPAN style="line-height: 15px;">Sophie-RO Yep it was a bit of a crisis point that I reached over the weekend! It was hard though to try and focus on something else. I don't know why I felt less fragile the next day, maybe it was that I was consciously trying to be more mindful of how I was feeling, and trying so hard not to push myself to any extent that would tip me over the edge again. I was definitely allowing myself more time and space emotionally. But really I can't recall anything that helped me feel better in the moment. It's hard, because as I sit here now, I don't actually remember feeling so bad that I wanted to end my life, which kinda scares me....</SPAN></P>\u000a<P>&nbsp;</P>\u000a<P>&nbsp;</P>\u000a<P><STRONG>Neg:</STRONG> Woke late again today. This is becoming too much of a habit Monday mornings.</P>\u000a<P><STRONG>Pos:</STRONG> I got to TAFE in time to set up my area (despite not knowing what I was on)</P>\u000a<P>&nbsp;</P>\u000a<P><STRONG>Neg:</STRONG> My teacher didn't seem impressed that I wasn't sure what area I was on.</P>\u000a<P><STRONG>Pos:</STRONG> Whatever. I'm doing the best I can, and right now if that means not writing out those plans than so be it. She will just have to accept that I'm doing the best and prioritising tasks. Right now, if I'm not keeping up with assessments how am I ment to with the weekly tasks? I'm setting myself boundaries and I'm trying so har to stick to them. Right now my health is more important than those tasks.</P>\u000a<P>&nbsp;</P>\u000a<P><STRONG>Neg</STRONG>: Have more spots over my body. But only the ones on my chest sting and itch. Hmm.</P>\u000a<P><STRONG>Pos:</STRONG> I saw my usual pharmasist this morning, she said to continue using the cream I got from the other chemist, and gave me another one to use alongside it, and to take these other tablets I had at home. She said that if it gets worse after a few days or doesn't improve after Friday to go see a gp.&nbsp;</P>\u000a<P><STRONG>Pos:</STRONG> The pharmsist is one of the better ones in town, I've only found one other chemist I feel ok to walk in and ask for advice, the rest feel to lack some professionalism..&nbsp;</P>\u000a<P>&nbsp;</P>\u000a<P><STRONG>Neg:</STRONG> When I ran into one of my old TAFE teachers in coles today, I felt an urge to smile and say everything was going fine, <STRONG>Pos:</STRONG>&nbsp;I fought it and opened up a little. Not only did I feel better opening up to her and letting some of the stuff out, I got a good response from her - one I should have expected, but didn't. I walked away feeling listened to and with a bit more confidence.</P>

VGreat Positive, <a href="http://forums.au.reachout.com/t5/user/viewprofilepage/user-id/4683">@Creativegirl12</a>! You're showing just how much strength you have! I believe you can get through this too!<BR /><BR />Have you tried writing down your feelings when you're feeling really emotionally charged? Sometimes expressing them on paper can really help dealing with highly emotional times. Art, music, a hobby or some form of exercise can also be really therapeutic and calming.

It doesn't mean you're controlling or untrusting. Relationships are built on trust and honesty. The fact that your girlfriend has been open with you about the moment her and her friend had last year is a really positive thing. It shows she trusts you and doesn't want to keep things from you.&nbsp;</P>\u000a<P>&nbsp;</P>\u000a<P>Have you spoken to your girlfriend about how you feel in this situation?&nbsp;</P>

I was in a panic attack from the start and found it incredibly hard to come out of that, and actually talk. I just shook the whole way through. I also spent most of the time looking at the ground instead of her. With a crook neck lol.</P>\u000a<P>&nbsp;</P>\u000a<P>She wants me to get some blood tests done, and was kinda surprised the gp didn't do any. She also talked a bit about medication. I'm scared about all this. I see her next Monday</P>\u000a<P>&nbsp;</P>\u000a<P>I'm wondering how others found their first apt with a psych/counsellor.&nbsp;</P>\u000a<P>1. Did you have trouble opening up? If so how did you manage that?</P>\u000a<P>2. What did you do before/ater apts to look after yourself?</P>

I think it should be more of using what I've got (reachout, my surivival kit, friends) rather than asking for help the minute things go down hill... so using eheadspace etc as a second or third option.&nbsp;</P>

V<a href="http://forums.au.reachout.com/t5/user/viewprofilepage/user-id/5111">@j95</a> try setting a bunch of different alarms around your room (or house) each with varying volumes and such. So that you have to get up (or even hide them). Don't worry, you'll be fine.<BR /><BR /><a href="http://forums.au.reachout.com/t5/user/viewprofilepage/user-id/5093">@stonepixie</a> that's right, only you know how you feel. Sometimes when you explain things to others, your words might not come out right, or they might misunderstand or not even understand. While you can ask people for help, sometimes only you really know the answer. <BR />

V<P>Thanks <a href="http://forums.au.reachout.com/t5/user/viewprofilepage/user-id/52">@Sophie-RO</a>&nbsp;sometimes this thread is the only thing keeping me moving forward... Sometimes the only reason I am able to see or even notice something has bee on my mind is when I wite it here. It seems to be a safe space for me. Really the only thing I'm doing to try and work through it, is trying to manage it with some breathing, distraction if possible at work. Its hard though because some days I just need to work beside someone to help calm the anxiety, where as other times I know I just need to be alone. And when I'm trying so hard not to let myself go into panic mode, it really drains my energy...</P>\u000a<P>&nbsp;</P>\u000a<P>At first thought, there isn't anyone I'd be feel ok to alk about this with. I mean with my colleagues, I don't know them well enough to know if that's something I could ask them. But also it would kinda feel weird. Going back to the GP early, I don't know, I haven' considered it, but it's not realy something I want to do, but I guess if it came down to it, I would. &nbsp;Making a thread seems fine, but I know it's internal - something inside of me i actually blocking me from taking that step! In regaurds to calling, I set myself a goal, I set a time, like today I told myself I would grab a recharge &nbsp;for my phone a couple days earlier so I had bonus talk to b able to ring the psych after work. Well after work, I thought about it, I brought up her number, but threw my phone onto the passenger seat instead of pressing the call button. Like my finger was right about it, and before it reached thes scre I gave up. So I really don't know how to approach it anymore. I don't understand why this is so hard for me. I struggle through 90% of things I try, but damned if I know why. I mean hell, I can talk myself out of anything faster than anyone can tell me what they want me to do. It's so frustrating.</P>\u000a<P>&nbsp;</P>\u000a<P>&nbsp;</P>\u000a<P>Neg: I'm disliking this whole facebok thing of "on this day", I keep getting all these posts from like 4 years ago, reminding me of an ol friendship, reminding me of how I used to be. Giving me another thing to feel bad about, because I don't think I'm fully over that friendship yet. <img class="emoticon emoticon-smileysad" id="smileysad" src="http://inspire.i.lithium.com/i/smilies/16x16_smiley-sad.png" alt="Smiley Sad" title="Smiley Sad" /></P>\u000a<P>Pos: I've tried making new friendships, I've been trying to move on from that friendship for too long now. I'm finding it hard now that I'm seeing them alot at work... I'm able to take a deep breath and act professionally like I do with other customers.</P>\u000a<P>&nbsp;</P>\u000a<P>Neg: Was going to ring the psych today. I chickened out again. Feeling bad about it. I mean if I can't even makethat damn call, how can I even expect to get better.</P>\u000a<P>Pos: I got as far as bringing up her number again. I'm trying to call her, continually bringing up her number, maybe one day I'll be able to actually press call.</P>\u000a<P>&nbsp;</P>\u000a<P>Neg: Been in the wars recently, I'm either huring myself with the way I move, or I'm getting injured by the things around me, just yesterday I got scratched by a cat being cared of the vac, and I managed to get a nail in my foot! My muscle in my arm is also sore from lifting the heavy boxes at work :/</P>\u000a<P>Pos: I've applied first aid to my arm/muscle, I've been using a muscle rub and heat/cold treatments. I'll take pain relief/nurofen for it tonight.</P>

V<P><STRONG>Neg</STRONG>: Had to deal with a shop-lifting incident yesterday. It really scared me and made my anxiety levels shoot through the roof!</P>\u000a<P><STRONG>Pos</STRONG>: I practiced some self-care by trying to keep my breathing slow and deep. I reminded myself that while it was scary, we didn't loose that stock! I focused my energies onto the next customer and tried to remain calm. I got a colleague to deal with the stock for me so I could continue serving the line of customers. The incident was on home time for me, so I only had to wait for my colleague to come back from her break so I could log off. I showed great courage by asking the person to check their bag. It was a HUGE step for me, previously I've let my supervisor do it.&nbsp;</P>\u000a<P>&nbsp;</P>\u000a<P><STRONG>Neg</STRONG>: Couldn't get a park in the council car-park opposite work yesterday, so I had to use the carpark down the road. I was nervous about an attack on my car because it was further from work and out of sight...</P>\u000a<P><STRONG>Pos</STRONG>: The walk to work did me good, gave me some breathing space. My car wasn't attacked! Which is awesome. I quite liked having to walk that bit of distance to my car. Maybe I can aim to walk to work for my morning/day shifts.</P>\u000a<P>&nbsp;</P>\u000a<P><STRONG>Neg</STRONG>: Feeling really stuck with this last bit of my assessment. I'm stressing because part of it is having to present it to the class, and I'm worried my anxiety levels will spike and make it impossible.. And I'm not even sure how long to make it or what I'm even doing with it. I feel so lost.</P>\u000a<P><STRONG>Pos</STRONG>: I need to remember that I've done this stuff before.

V<P>Thank you everyone for replying, it really means a lot. I've had some time to think and clear my head a little. And I've managed to compose a letter to give her next week. Unfortunately I haven't been able to keep on track with those 2 tasks she gave me, but I can always try again tomorrow. I don't expect to move mountains over night. Like <a href="http://forums.au.reachout.com/t5/user/viewprofilepage/user-id/4265">@Chessca_H</a>&nbsp;said "It's a process"</P>\u000a<P>&nbsp;</P>\u000a<P>I spoke with Eheadspace yesterday, and the clinician I've been working with will email me in 2 weeks, but said to email her if things get really hard with my apts with the psych. She wants me to move forward, but doesn't want to throw me intot he deep end without support. They've been good with that.</P>\u000a<P>&nbsp;</P>\u000a<P><a href="http://forums.au.reachout.com/t5/user/viewprofilepage/user-id/230">@Shadow</a>&nbsp;that helps me feel a bit better about it all. she hasn't said how I can contact her outside of sessions, but I DO have her email and phone number.</P>\u000a<P>&nbsp;</P>\u000a<P><a href="http://forums.au.reachout.com/t5/user/viewprofilepage/user-id/52">@Sophie-RO</a>&nbsp;that's what Eheadspace said, about it taking a while. The clinician I was working with there said it'd probably take me quite a few sessions to really feel comfortable talking about it. Given how I was when I started working with them.<BR />I think I could eventually connect with her. She was so patient with me, but at the same time she was bluntly honest which I think will take a bit of adjusting to, but I should be right.</P>\u000a<P>&nbsp;</P>\u000a<P>Thank you <a href="http://forums.au.reachout.com/t5/user/viewprofilepage/user-id/2306">@N1ghtW1ng</a>&nbsp;I think that was exactly what I needed to read!</P>\u000a<P>&nbsp;</P>\u000a<P><a href="http://forums.au.reachout.com/t5/user/viewprofilepage/user-id/4265">@Chessca_H</a>&nbsp;that's true, I guess I'm just comparing how I'm able to be so open with Eheadsapce yet, I closed off so much with the psych. I forgot the whole starting fresh thing.<BR />I honestly didn't think about how different things work for different people. I'll definitely check out that thread. I don't think I have yet!</P>\u000a<P>&nbsp;</P>\u000a<P><a href="http://forums.au.reachout.com/t5/user/viewprofilepage/user-id/214">@Birdeye</a> yeah I guess that's true. I just thought, I'd be able to be more calm but maybe not.. ohwell.<BR />That's a good idea, but I'm not 100% sure what exactly I'm scared/worried about with medication. She said she was the person to ask if I had any questions, and said there'd be minimal side effects with how we'd go about it.. Somewhere along the line she mentioned something about seeing a psychiatrist via video-link, but that it would be fairly simple as it's done with the gp. (I was actually surprised to hear we don't have any psychiatrists locally!)<BR />Yeah me and blood tests don't mix well. But her learning about that with me lightened the mood a little... But it's doable, as scared of them as I am, I can get through it.</P>

V<P>I moved out of home into a defacto relationship about a year ago now, and despite having troubles with my mum, who I used to live with (single parent), I have the feeling that she is very lonely and she often gets teary about that. She mentioned today that she may as well just kill herself because she feels like she's not really worth it anymore. Suffering from anxiety and deppression myself, this kind of relationship is setting me back quite significantly. Has anyone else ever had a depressed parent that they are worried about when they move out of home? I have been going to her place often and not sure what else I can do to really help her..</P>

V<a href="http://forums.au.reachout.com/t5/user/viewprofilepage/user-id/2306">@N1ghtW1ng</a> do you have paypal or something similar set up? Websites have been forced to make their paywalls so strong (due to consumer fears) that I'm pretty sure you're more likely to be ripped off/have your identity stolen when buying stuff in-store (because of people not covering the machine when entering their PIN etc.) Anyway it's entirely up to you, but if you go through safe channels it's mostly fine. As for the shirts, toss a coin? When the coin's up in the air you'll often secretly wish for it to land on heads or tails, and that can help guide your decision. The Tumblr pictures thing sounds interesting too!

I could relate to some of your thoughts on gift giving and sitting alone in restaurants - your positives helped me see those things a little differently too, so thanks! <img class="emoticon emoticon-smileyhappy" id="smileyhappy" src="http://inspire.i.lithium.com/i/smilies/16x16_smiley-happy.png" alt="Smiley Happy" title="Smiley Happy" /> hope you got the sleep you needed too.<BR /><BR />Negative: dad's home this morning while mum's still at work.

Win-win. Plus dad will be at work when I get home so it's only this morning that I need to deal with him. I've had to face this situation before and have survived - there's no reason why this time should be any different.<BR /><BR />Negative: this assignment is stressing me out so much because I'm procrastinating it. I'm used to starting my assignments early so this doesn't happen. I just don't want to do it.<BR />Positive: it's my last assignment for this semester. Once it's done that'll be it! The reason I'm delaying working on it is because I'm waiting to get a previous assignment back - the feedback from it will help me complete this new task. I should have my marks back by tomorrow which will give me the weekend + Monday to do it. It's only 1500 words so it shouldn't take too long.

Getting paypal if the website uses it (most do) can also be a really good way to go.<BR />I avoided any online shopping for years and now it's where I get the vast majority of my clothes (and even other things like gifts) from. Just make sure you consult the sizing guide for clothing! I've had no problems in regards to payment yet.

VNegative: I feel pretty irritable and stressed out. Can't focus. Uni isn't helping my edginess today. Being elevated makes me edgy at the same time too. <BR /><BR />Positive: I still have time to work out what works for me before my assignments are due and before my exams. I just need to find a way around it.

I also think volunteering will be helpful. <BR /><BR />When I first came to uni, I would introduce myself to people in lecture, and randomly start talking to them. Once you start talking to them it gets a lot easier, its just a matter of approaching them. Remember there are people in the same position as you, and you're not alone in feeling this way. <BR /><BR />Hope the best <img class="emoticon emoticon-smileyhappy" id="smileyhappy" src="http://inspire.i.lithium.com/i/smilies/16x16_smiley-happy.png" alt="Smiley Happy" title="Smiley Happy" />.

V<P>Hey <a href="http://forums.au.reachout.com/t5/user/viewprofilepage/user-id/4683">@Creativegirl12</a></P>\u000a<P>&nbsp;</P>\u000a<P>Firstly, glad to hear&nbsp;you are feeling good and wanting to do lots of things <img class="emoticon emoticon-smileyhappy" id="smileyhappy" src="http://inspire.i.lithium.com/i/smilies/16x16_smiley-happy.png" alt="Smiley Happy" title="Smiley Happy" />&nbsp; I think&nbsp;getting distracted and behind in work is&nbsp;something that every uni student struggles with from time to time, especially when all those assignments start building up. If it makes you feel any better, I am 5 weeks behind on all my coursework and have no intention of starting tonight so I think we are in the same boat <img class="emoticon emoticon-smileywink" id="smileywink" src="http://inspire.i.lithium.com/i/smilies/16x16_smiley-wink.png" alt="Smiley Wink" title="Smiley Wink" /></P>\u000a<P>&nbsp;</P>\u000a<P>&nbsp;</P>\u000a<P>I can really relate to what your saying. Its so hard to start uni work when your mood is all over the place- sometimes it feels like the last thing you want to do, and even if you manage to open a textbook it can feel&nbsp;impossible to concentrate. If it helps, what I do when I am in a low mood or finding it hard to concentrate is to do all the "easy" stuf that doesnt take much thinking - eg if its an assignment&nbsp;do the referencing and formatting, or even if you&nbsp;have lectures to watch choose the easier or more interesting topics.&nbsp;Usually I find that&nbsp;after making that first step I end up getting some work done.</P>\u000a<P>&nbsp;</P>\u000a<P>Perhaps you could even try some meditation or breathing exercises to help calm you down physically, and then your thoughts and concentration will probably follow <img class="emoticon emoticon-smileyhappy" id="smileyhappy" src="http://inspire.i.lithium.com/i/smilies/16x16_smiley-happy.png" alt="Smiley Happy" title="Smiley Happy" /> I also really like <a href="http://forums.au.reachout.com/t5/user/viewprofilepage/user-id/1192">@ElleBelle</a>&nbsp;time management suggestion, I'm sure that could really help.

And even tho I hated what we talked about I know in the long run it will make me better. <BR /><BR />Negative: it's only 5 and half weeks til I go away. it is meant to be a good thing but I'm worried I'm too unstable to go. I'm getting so stressed about it. <BR />Positive: hopefully I'll be having such a good time my mental health will be ok. and I will have mum around if anything goes wrong.

V<P>Hi Guys,</P>\u000a<P>&nbsp;</P>\u000a<P>You all have helped me so much already over the years, but I'm really struggling right now, and it was at <a href="http://forums.au.reachout.com/t5/user/viewprofilepage/user-id/52">@Sophie-RO</a>'s&nbsp; suggestion that I am writting this tonight.</P>\u000a<P>&nbsp;</P>\u000a<P>As a lot of you know, I finally managed to see a GP about my mental health at the start of March. Since then I've been on this really scary rollercoaster which is really beginning to really destroy me. And I think I'm leting it...</P>\u000a<P>&nbsp;</P>\u000a<P>At first I was really confused on who to see, and decided to try my #1 preference, I tried several times, even eheadspace tried, but then she went on holidays over easter. With the suggestion of Eheadsapce, I began trying to reach another psych. #2. I managed to send an email over easter, and she tried to call me a couple of times, but I missed the calls due to work. She replied to my email saying she'd try again last week (but that never happened). I've been too scared to try calling her back. Hell I'm scared of anything at this point.</P>\u000a<P>&nbsp;</P>\u000a<P>Right now I'm torn between where to try now. I ran into my #1 preference tonight in the supermarket, and was reminded why I wanted to work with her. (Back story, she is the parent of a girl I studied on my last prac!)&nbsp;</P>\u000a<P>&nbsp;</P>\u000a<P>Either way I know I need to make that initial, retchred and horrible phonecall. And that is what I am really stuck on. No matter who I try to ring, I'm extremely scared, anxious. I can't even bring myself to hit call. And I just feel so terrible that I can't manage to do anything. It's all too hard.</P>\u000a<P>&nbsp;</P>\u000a<P>For those who have taken that step, how did you manage it? Did you feel incredibly anxious like me?&nbsp;</P>\u000a<P>Does anyone have any advice or tips, anything to help me through? (<EM>Right now I'm ready to give up on the whole notion of getting better, because it just doesn't seem possible right now..</EM>)</P>\u000a<P>&nbsp;</P>\u000a<P>&nbsp;</P>\u000a<P>Thanks a bunch,</P>\u000a<P>Bee</P>

Like at times I want to cry, yet don't have the tears, yet when I'm feeling somewhat ok, tears are rolling from my eyes. It's crazy. I don't understand half of it...<BR />I know they're there, but part of me doesn't want to utilize the service. It's me, like if I manage to contact them, it's real. Despite the years I've suffered, it still doesn't feel real... I also don't really accept it, I don't want to. I guess that's why I've really struggled to access help...

VWould it be possible to defer the course instead?<BR /><BR />Or take either less hours or even use up some leave time for a bit of time away from work?<BR /><BR />I want to say that it's completely okay to not know everything right now. It's /only/ your third prac. People learn new things on the job all the time. the important thing isn't that you're at your best now, but that you know more now than you did at your last prac.<BR />Also, that actually sounds to me like you did two pretty great things with those kids. You don't have to have a whole ton of focuses each day, having the focus of keeping one kid comfortable for a day is fine.<BR /><BR />At my work I'll often be alone in one section with absolutely nothing to do and the music is like elevator music, and I find myself often just singing along to whatever song I can get in my head. Not loud enough for anyone aside from myself to actually hear me, but it makes it a lot more bearable. <BR />Maybe you could ask your co-workers what they do when they're on registers and it's quiet?

VHey <a href="http://forums.au.reachout.com/t5/user/viewprofilepage/user-id/6893">@divorceocd84</a> and welcome to Reachout.<BR />It can be hard to remember to take care of yourself when you are there for others. Especially when you are struggling with something. What you say makes sense <img class="emoticon emoticon-smileyhappy" id="smileyhappy" src="http://inspire.i.lithium.com/i/smilies/16x16_smiley-happy.png" alt="Smiley Happy" title="Smiley Happy" /> little things can find there way in and before you realise it, affect you.  <BR />Try taking some time for yourself and talking to some people close to you that you trust. Having a few people close to you who you can turn to for support is a nice thing.

It's the whole phone thing I can't grasp. It's hard with anything for me.<BR /><BR />That was kinda sounding ok while reading it, then this happened..<BR /><BR />I just received a second call from the psych today. (Soph's point about promising myself to answer the call rang through my mind as I reached for my phone..) Jittery, Anxious, barely able to talk. Gee, it was like my gp apt all over again. The shaking. The wanting to just run... But I managed to kinda talk to her I guess. I have an apt on the 11th.<BR /><BR /><BR />I'm jut feeling so shaky now. unsure. confused. anxious. scared. All these thoughts. I don't know anymore.

I more identified with being asexual but I really don't know where I sit anymore.&nbsp;</P>\u000a<P><BR />There are other types of attraction including sexual, romantic, sensual, platonic and more. Unless you see the women and think sexual things with them, feel that you want to, it's not sexual attraction. It could be more idealistic, that you want to be like them because you admire them. <BR />Your attraction towards men could have dropped because you are happy with your boyfriend and no longer need to see another man in that way. <BR /><BR />Stress could also play a part in these thoughts and feelings. <BR /><BR />With the article, things can change. However someone's orientation is set. While it might fluctuate, it is still set. So while you might be gay, you might, once or twice, find an attraction to a woman however thinking of her as attractive doesn't change anything. You can still think 'that woman is attractive' however if you don't feel anything towards her, then there's no attraction. You can still acknowledge it. Did that make sense?<BR /><BR />Wishing you the best <a href="http://forums.au.reachout.com/t5/user/viewprofilepage/user-id/6846">@Titanomachina</a>. You are a strong, kind and amazing person!

V<P>I feel like I have tried everything else, so maybe thing will help. I can hid behind my screen yet at the same time feel like I am actually telling someone about my problem.</P>\u000a<P>&nbsp;</P>\u000a<P>I don't know why I hate myself.&nbsp;</P>\u000a<P>&nbsp;</P>\u000a<P>Actually thats a lie, I know why. What I don't understand is why I can't convience myself that its all in my head. I live an extremly previliged life. I have an amazing family, great friends and honestly my life is pretty easy. I feel like I should be happy all the time, but the truth is that I am hardly ever happy. Yet no one seems to see that. I feel like I want to yell out for help because I am drowning yet I don't have a voice, and even if I did no one would be able to hear me anyways.&nbsp;</P>\u000a<P>&nbsp;</P>\u000a<P>I hate myself so mcuh. The only reason I continue to push through is because I love my family and friends and I know that their lives would not be easier without me, well at least not at first. My little sister is my best friend and I know she looks up to me and loves me and it would mess her up to know that I am messed up. She has a hard enough time with me away at college, I don't know what she would do if I was gone forever. My parents are the same way. They love me so much, and I know it. Thats why I can't talk to them though, they would be so destroyed to figure out that I am so f*$%ed up, they would feel like they failed me as my parents. Which of course isn't true. Its not their fault, they have only ever been supportive and loving.</P>\u000a<P>&nbsp;</P>\u000a<P>So on to why I hate myself.&nbsp;</P>\u000a<P>&nbsp;</P>\u000a<P>First, I am not a good person. I try, I really do. I volunteer, I love to help people and heal people. But I can do better, I still hurt people. Maybe its not intentional, but I do. I can do so much more for the world and yet I don't do it. How can I love myself knowing that I am not doing all the good I could be? Mother Theresa helped millions of people, and yet I am over here being selfish, watching netflix and feeling sorry for myself.</P>\u000a<P>&nbsp;</P>\u000a<P>Second, I am not smart. I don't get good grades. I can't even say that I try to get all As because I don't. I just feel like there is more to life then simply getting good grades. Thats when reality sets back in and I realize I need to do well in school to do well in life, at least according to socities ideals.</P>\u000a<P>&nbsp;</P>\u000a<P>Third, I have a hard time beliving that anyone likes me. Really, I question how much my friends want to be friends with me all the time. Why? Because I wouldn't want to be friends with myself. So why should they want to waste their time on me. I am in a Sorority and yet I feel all the girls are able to connect so much deeper then myself. I just have a really hard time making a deep emotional connection.</P>\u000a<P>&nbsp;</P>\u000a<P>Fourth, I have now had sex with 9 guys. I am a slut. I am 20 years old. The last one i stopped us as soon as we started because I knew that wasn't what I wanted. I hate myself so much for having sex. People tell you then to just stop but I spent my life growing up being told that I was attractive and having society drop my self worth to how much guys want me. Don't get me wrong, I wear the typical girl next door outfit. You know jeans and natural make up are pretty much my go to. Yet I never have a problem getting guys, in fact I have a harder time getting them to stay away. The things is that no guy wants to date me. I am the slam piece that they get to brag to their friends about. When I am really depressed I find a guy to adore me and to tell me that I am attractive and then they usual make a move, where that all leads to depends. Usually I don't stop it because I trust the guy and they are one of my friends, but then afterwards I hate myself for it so much that it causes me to feel ill.&nbsp;</P>\u000a<P>&nbsp;</P>\u000a<P>Sorry for the long rant, I will probably have more to say later. I just had to get these thigs out because I don't know how much longer I can keep it all in.</P>

VHey <a href="http://forums.au.reachout.com/t5/user/viewprofilepage/user-id/238">@Bee</a> I'm just... I'm super proud of you! Really. Even if it didn't go so well you did it, and I (and everyone else here) is super proud of you for that. <BR /><BR />I can't really remember my first appointment but I don't have the same troubles with talking about my problems. Sorry that I can't be of much help there. <BR /><BR />To answer your other question (the first one) I think that people find it easier to put themselves down because it is just that, easier. When you build yourself up, it can seem like a lot of work. You have to think about what you're good at, positive things(which you are amazing at, by the way) and putting yourself down is simpler. <BR /><BR />Choosing sleep is definitely an alright choice, it's important to stay rested because a lack of sleep can sometimes make things worse. <BR /><BR />You've got this <a href="http://forums.au.reachout.com/t5/user/viewprofilepage/user-id/238">@Bee</a> because you are definitely so brave and we are all proud of you.

V<P><STRONG>Negative</STRONG>: Didn't sleep til way after 2 last night. It was super hard to sleep, then wake this morning. I just wanted to ignore the world today.</P>\u000a<P><STRONG>Positive</STRONG>: I eventually fell asleep. I eventually got up and went to work. I faced the world and smiled a little.</P>\u000a<P>&nbsp;</P>\u000a<P><STRONG>Negative</STRONG>: Really struggled through my shift today. I was close to ringing my supervisor and saying I needed to leave the registers for a while, but a colleague relieved me for my break, however my break didn't help me much. I found it so hard to even focus on my breathing. It was soo hard. The 4.5 hour shift just felt too draining...</P>\u000a<P><STRONG>Positive</STRONG>: My colleague had amazing timing at coming to relieve me because I was so close to panic. I managed to the end of my shift. I kept trying to breathe deep, not focus too much on how quickly, but trying to just make sure they were controlled. As counting was only stressing me out even more.</P>\u000a<P>&nbsp;</P>\u000a<P><STRONG>Negative</STRONG>: My gp was running late today, which heightened my anxiety. At first she didn't realise it was my 3month follow up apt. She also had no idea that the psych was meant to write a letter, so the psych either ran out of time or forgot. Meh. I just wanted to run away and hide. It was SO VERY hard not to close off and run. I didn't even hear her call my name the first time. Blergh.</P>\u000a<P><STRONG>Positive</STRONG>: I managed to say it was the follow up apt she wanted me to attend. She looked for said letter but couldn't find it. The gp apt overall was ok I guess.&nbsp;</P>\u000a<P>&nbsp;</P>\u000a<P><STRONG>Negative</STRONG>: Feeling very over it all right now. Feeling like just packing up and running away. I don't want to be here right now. I don't want to face anything in my life right now. It's all feeling too hard. I just want to rid it all. <img class="emoticon emoticon-smileysad" id="smileysad" src="http://inspire.i.lithium.com/i/smilies/16x16_smiley-sad.png" alt="Smiley Sad" title="Smiley Sad" /></P>\u000a<P><STRONG>Positive</STRONG>: I'm getting through one day at a time right now. I'm trynig SO HARD NOT TO STRESS over the following day. I will get through this.<SPAN style="line-height: 15px;">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>\u000a<P><STRONG>Positive</STRONG>: I have 2 choices, I can contact Eheadspace or I can contact my psych. Right now I'm going to keep that in mind and try to calm my body and find a better space mentally.</P>\u000a<P>&nbsp;</P>\u000a<P><STRONG>Negative</STRONG>: The gp asked some tough questions today. Some relating to SH &amp; suicide. I really didn't want to answer them. I felt too scared...</P>\u000a<P><STRONG>Positive</STRONG>: I answered them anyway. Because I knew it was better to be honest. I told myself that I told the psych, I might aswell let the gp know, afterall she is INVOLVED in my care right now.</P>\u000a<P>&nbsp;</P>\u000a<P><STRONG>Negative</STRONG>: I forgot to ask the reception staff for an apt in 2 weeks when I finished today. I only realised when I got to the chemist.</P>\u000a<P><STRONG>Positive</STRONG>: I CAN book that online myself. Which might give me some freedom and make it a little easier.</P>\u000a<P>&nbsp;</P>\u000a<P><STRONG>Negative</STRONG>: I'm not feeling very safe right now. My head is just ruminating on so many thoughts. I'm agitated and just wanting to be left alone. I'm not feeling able to make any clear rasional decisions right now. I'm kind of scared.</P>\u000a<P><STRONG>Positive</STRONG>: I can do some journalling to help with the supports. Being alone may help me calm down. I know where to find a list of numbers to call if I get really bad. I WIl make contact if I can't cope anymore. If it gets to that point, I WILL write it down for my psych.</P>\u000a<P>&nbsp;</P>\u000a<P><STRONG>Negative</STRONG>: I don't feel like facing work tomorrow. It's an 8am shift and I'm tired of feeling so tired. I'm scared I'm going to feel really anxious again like today. I'm scared that it may get very busy and I'll be stuck at the registers. I'm scared of Sunday, being at the registers for 3 hours, I don't know if I'll cope being in express for that long again!</P>\u000a<P><STRONG>Positive</STRONG>: I just need to take it as it comes. I know if it comes to it, I feel like I could say to my weekend morning supervisor that I need some time away from the registers for a while. I'm sure she'll work something out if it gets to that.</P>\u000a<P>&nbsp;</P>\u000a<P><STRONG>Negative</STRONG>: I don't want to go to prac next week. I don't feel emotionally or mentally stable enough right now. I have all these thoughts and worries about what could happen, worries abou worries and thoughts. I'm kinda scared of them. I'm scared that I won't know how to handle it if they arrise.</P>\u000a<P><STRONG>Positive</STRONG>: I'll attend the first day and see how I go. I will try my best. I have my psych to call on if I just can't cope with it. She gave me intructions to leave if I needed but to go back the following day. My teacher said to keep contact and only share what I was comfortable with. I HAVE this support this time. I have done this before. I CAN do this.</P>\u000a<P>&nbsp;</P>

V<a href="http://forums.au.reachout.com/t5/user/viewprofilepage/user-id/6447">@mark0154</a> I know what you mean. I went through a similar experience with my school. They rarely let me played and the one time I had a chance, I almost missed it because no one bothered to tell the other players. I kept it up, and wasn't even recognised for the hard work I put in, the weekends without knowing if I would play or not. <BR />While you might of missed this opportunity, there are still more. It might be tough, but I suggest going to the trainings. Keep up your hard work, and it will be noticed. <BR /><BR />Try adding a new activity into your week. Something different. One time, I was bored while walking trying to find a tennis court so I can up with a silly routine to entertain myself and got my friend involved too. We had our rackets so with each step I would shout Serve! Serve! and throw the racket(sorry, I'm spelling it wrong) the way I would when I served and kept doing it for forehands, backhands(each one twice) and moving my feet too. <BR /><BR />Do you have anyone you can talk to? <a href="http://forums.au.reachout.com/t5/user/viewprofilepage/user-id/3030">@blithe</a> has given some helpful ideas and there are some good factsheets that can help you out on this website.

Grief affects different people in different ways.&nbsp;<A href="http://au.reachout.com/common-reactions-to-death" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">This</A>&nbsp;is a factsheet on common reactions to death and&nbsp;<A href="http://au.reachout.com/working-through-grief" target="_self" rel="nofollow">this</A>&nbsp;is about working through grief. And&nbsp;<A href="http://au.reachout.com/tough-times/loss-and-grief" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">here</A>&nbsp;are a list of stories all about loss and grief that you can search through if they might help you. (All the links open in a new page <img class="emoticon emoticon-smileyhappy" id="smileyhappy" src="http://inspire.i.lithium.com/i/smilies/16x16_smiley-happy.png" alt="Smiley Happy" title="Smiley Happy" />)&nbsp;</P>\u000a<P>&nbsp;</P>\u000a<P>Some people hide their grief and continue about their lives while others are more open about it. Everyone reacts in a different way depending on different factors like who they are grieving, their relationship with them, what is going on in their life at the moment (for example, a busy person might not find the time to grieve) and so on. It's okay if you don't feel like crying, you might not even feel anything. In fact, everyone in my family reacts a little different to grief. My mother is more inward, so she is strong for us so to speak. My father will usually hide his grief but will often be a little more angrier and touchy about things, it's similar with my brother although he will cry more. My sister will just cry, be sad about it, open about her grief. I'm more inward and sometimes can be touchy. I don't cry and I often don't know what to feel. I confessed to my friend once after my grandmother had passed away a few weeks ago and told her I haven't cried. Honestly, I can't remember what she said, but that wasn't a bad thing. It was just my way of dealing with grief.&nbsp;</P>\u000a<P>&nbsp;</P>\u000a<P>If you feel yourself about to cry, try not to hold it back. If the situation calls for it, try to excuse yourself so you can go someplace quiet. Let yourself let it out, I personally feel better after crying. Even if you don't feel anything, that doesn't matter. You're not alone in feeling that. Know that no matter how you do feel, it isn't the wrong way to feel, only you know which way is best for you.&nbsp;</P>\u000a<P>&nbsp;</P>\u000a<P>N1ghtW1ng</P>

It's okay if you only see someone for a little bit when they're your option for seeing someone you need.

It's something that happens when you spent so many years using it (this thread) as a daily task (well nearly!)<BR /><BR />Neg: Got to a point today where I just couldn't interact with the children. It felt too hard.<BR />Pos: One girl in particular wanted me to interact with her - her persistence helped me pull myself back to reality! I tried to look after myself by putting it into perspective, I was nervous about 2 big things today which were taking up A LOT of space in my mind, which was making the interactions feel impossible.<BR /><BR />Neg: Felt silly during my presentation because it was so different and I had no confidence within myself to do it.<BR />Pos: I GOT THROUGH IT. I got confirmation that I PASSED it today! The confidence I something I am still working on each day.<BR /><BR />Neg: Feeling conflicted upon myself about everything. On one hand I'm feeling all so very ashamed about mental illness still, yet on the other, the psych explanation today really helped me see it's not. I'm just so conflicted about what I actually believe.<BR />Pos: It's okay to still feel conflicted. I know not to be too harsh on myself with it. Within time I'll believe it's nothing to be ashamed of...

V<P>I've had a really difficult last&nbsp;12 months. I have a history of mental illness in my family but these feelings are&nbsp;new to me personally. 9 months ago my father passed away from lung cancer, just 4 months after he was diagnosed. While he was sick I was away at military training and I couldn't be with him. I was alone and away from all my family and friends. I was allowed to leave once to see him before he died but only for a couple days. While this was happening, my boyfriend at the time was deployed. I cheated on him. I returned home in September and told my boyfriend the truth in January (he returned home in November). He broke up with me. He was gone along with the dog we had shared for the last three years. All this loss sent me spiraling but I had started to work through it. A couple days ago I was sexually assaulted by someone I believed to be my friend. I feel very anxious, sad, guilty, and scared all the time now. Sometimes these feelings hit me so hard all I can do is lay down and cry. When I'm not overwhelmed by these feelings, I feel like I'm in a haze. I've always been able to deal with whatever comes my way. My family is baffled because I am usually "such a strong person." I don't know how to get back to normal...</P>

VI did it. I wrote something, I am doubting that I will be one of the two chosen. So many people (obviously) applied and only two will be chosen. It sucks because I'm afraid of online payments and at the moment I can't really pay for something like an online course, it would be too difficult to sort out the money and such. Free would be, amazing. I'm hoping for the best! On Tuesday I find out. I'm excited and nervous all at the same time!

VI am proud of myself today for standing up and letting the optometrist reception staff know how unjust their expectations were. I was clear about what I wasn't happy with and demanded they explain what they meant by a phrase I didn't know. I don't think I'd have wearable glasses if I didn't stand up for myself, and have my mother in the background.<BR /><BR />I'm proud of myself for how far I've coped recently. Despite all the negative thoughts and emotions and everything going on, I've managed to refrain from physically hurting myself!

V<a href="http://forums.au.reachout.com/t5/user/viewprofilepage/user-id/6147">@bessie94</a> maybe. However it only brought on more of me being stuffed around by my optometrist. I just wish they could make up their mind and stop changing their story! But thankfully I can keep these ones I just need to wait for my arm to come back repaired so I can have my glasses not looking like a throw together story haha<BR /><BR />With the psych I'm only just starting out with her, but my previous contact with Eheadspace has been in contact with her and passed on some info, so I'm hoping I can be as open wit her.<BR /><BR /><BR />Neg: Got stuffed around by the optometrist today again.<BR />Pos: After me standing my ground, complaining and letting them know how unjust it was for them to expect me to go 1-2weeks without my glasses, I got action happening. They agreed to stick another arm on my frame (however it looks horrid) and they ended up sending the arm away for a new hinge to be attached.<BR /><BR />Neg: My glasses look horrid right now, and I was kinda looking forward to a new look.<BR />Pos: It's only a couple weeks. I don't have to find an extra 4-500$ for new glasses, so I'm saving myself some money, especially since I've only just got the right lenses in these ones! <BR /><BR />Neg: Haven't been feeling the best today. Emotionally I've been all over the place.<BR />Pos: I know it's because of a mixture of things. I'm doing the best to take care of myself by practicing deep breathing and trying to focus on some positive things.

VI will, of course, remain neutral in the war between soft and hard tacos, should a battle occur. <BR /><BR /><BR />However I do strongly enjoy soft tacos as I can actually eat them without spilling taco and innards(of the taco, not actual digestive track) all over my plate.<BR /><BR /><BR />And right now I am deciding what to write. I am going to write why I want to do this writing course, a chance to do it for free. I'm really hoping I do! My friend once won VIP tickets to an amazing horse show (and took me with her!!) so I can win this, it's not all that rare. <img class="emoticon emoticon-smileyvery-happy" id="smileyvery-happy" src="http://inspire.i.lithium.com/i/smilies/16x16_smiley-very-happy.png" alt="Smiley Very Happy" title="Smiley Very Happy" />

(Because Optimus Prime) <BR /><BR />NEG: So my ability to spell has decided to leave me. Almost every time I wrote the word optimistic I wrote it om or optimus. I'm also jumping the gun, only writing half a word before moving onto the next and forgetting letters on the ends of words.<BR />POS: I live a fast life. <img class="emoticon emoticon-smileytongue" id="smileytongue" src="http://inspire.i.lithium.com/i/smilies/16x16_smiley-tongue.png" alt="Smiley Tongue" title="Smiley Tongue" /> Not really, but I do write fast, and type fast, so of course I'm going to occasionally, very often, make mistakes. It's not all bad.<BR /><BR />NEG: Whenever I read, I feel like I have to go back and reread the page, or turn back to the previous page because I forgot what just happened. So often, it's really annoying when I'm reading.<BR />POS: I read fast. And I don't have the best memory, especially short term like what happened a minute, or three seconds ago. It's okay.<BR /><BR />NEG: I feel really, really stupid. Not in general, although sometimes I do feel stupid intellectually. But at the moment it's writing these negatives into positives. It doesn't make any sense, the positives feel like negatives or fakes. It's not helping. <BR />POS: Maybe this just isn't for me. I already find positives from negative situations from my head, so I assumed that this would be helpful, but it isn't, and that's okay. I'll find something else.

What if i push this person away and find I've wasted a friendship (or more) because I can't handle trusting people so I push them away and get so anxious about it that I just drop contact with them,

V<P><a href="http://forums.au.reachout.com/t5/user/viewprofilepage/user-id/214">@Birdeye</a> I was thinking of seeing my family GP next week and getting a referral for psychiatrist now rather than waiting till my parents come across. Maybe try to fit in an appointment in before I go overseas during the break. While it won't be convenient at this stage to travel to the psychiatrist on the other side, it should be easier from when they move back.&nbsp;</P>

V<a href="http://forums.au.reachout.com/t5/user/viewprofilepage/user-id/1192">@ElleBelle</a> I could look into that approach, maybe I just need to try something new. I'll see what I can do, I have my next psych app in a week and a half, I'll see what I can do till then. Then maybe I can talk to her about it. How to get around studying when I have major mood swings.  <BR /><BR /><a href="http://forums.au.reachout.com/t5/user/viewprofilepage/user-id/6450">@Aria</a> I guess its common among uni students. I guess its frustrating that I feel like I don't have control over how I'm feeling. Up and down, round and about. It's like either way, I lose my focus. Whether I'm up or down. I really want to do well and get through this degree. <BR /><BR /><a href="http://forums.au.reachout.com/t5/user/viewprofilepage/user-id/6129">@benjamin_</a> I could try studying outside my room. My room is definitely a huge distraction, there's so much I can do. I think I'm also less likely to move around everyone and start singing when i'm outside of my room.

V<P>Hey Sophie thanks for the reply.....</P>\u000a<P>Off course u're right.I understand that the apparatus presents a certain perspective and that you maybe can make a mistake by interpreting the results in a biased way, it's like when religious people ignore facts and adapt(distort the facts or their certain aspect of belief to fit the major aspect) them to their belief...(a.k.a apologist).But............</P>\u000a<P>Isnt internal thinking and turning negatives into positives also biased? Aren't we lying to ourselves when we say:well i have no job but hey at least that women smiled at me today....That doesnt improve the situation, well it may keep me sane for a few moments but tommorow when i wake up i face the so called reality again,( when bills arrive).</P>\u000a<P>I just dont understand why should i keep fighting, on the other hand i cant seem to find the courage to end my life.</P>\u000a<P>Its a horrible place to be in, i always remember a line from my uncle's stories:</P>\u000a<P>"Son, remember, the only fight it matters in your life is the war against yourself."</P>\u000a<P>How can you know if u won or lost?</P>\u000a<P>"Son every day you will have a battle, and you can consider every battle as a victory as long as you know you lost, in other words, Son you have to keep you sanity!</P>\u000a<P>Poor english but i think u get the point...........</P>\u000a<P>i dont know anymore if i'm insane or not.</P>

V<P>When I first met my husband 8 years ago, he was frequently smoking marijuana. I don't like it but didn't really have a problem with it as long as the time and place was appropriate. We had always spoken about it and all I asked was for his honesty. He had said many times that he would quit when we had kids.</P>\u000a<P>We had our first child a little over a year ago and he did stop smoking for my pregnancy, socially smoking twice during my pregnancy which I didn't have a problem with, as it wasn't around me or affecting anyone but himself. When my son was 2 months old I caught him smoking at home in the afternoon and he tried to hide it. We had a big arguement and I told him that my kids will not be raised around that life and there's no more chances.&nbsp;</P>\u000a<P>My son is now just over 1 and I am 2 months pregnant with our second and I walked out to my husband having a smoke beside the car whilst my son was sitting in the car whilst I was inside at our friends house. He wasn't in the car with our son but I am furious that it was in front of our child.&nbsp;</P>\u000a<P>He is disgusted in himself and says it will never happen again, he doesn't even know why he chose to have some.&nbsp;</P>\u000a<P>I don't have a problem with him socially having a smoke with friends when the time is appropriate but this is not acceptable.&nbsp;</P>\u000a<P>I am not sure if I am over reacting or if I should leave.</P>\u000a<P>Where can I get help or find someone to talk to about this because none of our family knows and I have no one to talk to about this.&nbsp;</P>\u000a<P>Do I leave or stay and try and work it out. If I stay, how do I go about repairing our family?</P>

I know when I get really down and hate myself I try to self sooth and do things to pamper myself even if I feel I don't deserve it. My favourite things include have a shower or bath, lighting a scented candle and focus on the scent engulfing my body, going for a walk, or chucking my favourite show on and veging out. <BR />You are a worthwhile person and deserve everything opportunity in life

V<a href="http://forums.au.reachout.com/t5/user/viewprofilepage/user-id/238">@Bee</a> thanks for having the continuing courage to talk about how you've been feeling. Assessments can bring with them a huge amount of stress.<BR /><BR />When I feel overwhelmed with work or and assessment, I write out a checklist of the individual things I need to complete for the assessment, start at the top and get through them one by one. This might sound really simple, but it's super effective as I get a feeling of accomplishment after crossing off one item on the list. Even if it's only one, I know it's one less thing I have to do and as I make my way down the list, I fell less and less stressed.<BR /><BR />Have you had a chance to speak with your psych over the weekend or make an appointment for this week?

She said that this prac would be the best in that it's only 2 weeks and not too much work. Also because I'm in a nursery, it's all really simple stuff. Yay. She said to keep contact, to email her if I needed, and said whatever I was comfortable sharing.</P>\u000a<P><STRONG>Positive</STRONG>; She wasn't pushy in wanting to know anything, she also didn't seem to sway in a negative direction with the issues, which could make hte process a little easier.</P>\u000a<P>&nbsp;</P>\u000a<P><STRONG>Negative</STRONG>: I have this pain in my side/lower back on my right side. I really don't know why or where it came from&nbsp;</P>\u000a<P><STRONG>Positive</STRONG>: I'm trying to keep my posture straight. I will do some stretches soon to see if it will help any</P>\u000a<P>&nbsp;</P>\u000a<P><STRONG>Negative</STRONG>: I have my 3 month follow up apt with the GP tomorrow and I'm kinda nervous about it because the psych wrote a letter to her asking for medication &amp; blood tests to be done. I'm scared that she'll run late because mum wants to take me out shopping and knows I finish at 2.30.</P>\u000a<P><STRONG>Positive</STRONG>: I DID agree for the psych to write that letter. I agreed to have the tests and get the medication. I can't think of any reason NOT to take the medication - the psych has been awesome in explaining it all for me and made me feel quite safe in the process. I can always stretch the truth with mum as to why I didn't come home so quick. It usually takes me 1/2hour to get home anyway.</P>\u000a<P>&nbsp;</P>\u000a<P><STRONG>Negative</STRONG>: It would be somewhat easier if I could just be open with mum abuot this stuff, at least saying that I've go an apt to go to, instead of alway trying to find ways to get out of it all.</P>\u000a<P><STRONG>Positive</STRONG>: I'm working on that. It's something I can with through with the psych, or &nbsp;can try to be open wth mum myself.</P>\u000a<P>&nbsp;</P>\u000a<P><STRONG>Negative</STRONG>: Got so close to telling one of my sueprvisors about my mental health struggles, but I shyed away before I could even alue to it.</P>\u000a<P><STRONG>Positive</STRONG>: I did eventually say the long 10hr shifts I couldn't cope mentally. My supervisor is always so great when I'm trying to get things out, she never pushes me for anything. which is so good. I can go at my pace. I think she pickd up tday that I needed a distraction, because I was able to do evrey other job but stay on registers too long. So that was awesome.</P>

Hospital is sometimes needed but it doesn't have to be a negative experience. Use it to learn about services, learn about your condition, learn about yourself. Don't be afraid to talk to your nurses they are there to help you. ask lots of questions. Talk to other patients as well, I've found good friends while I've been in hospital many of which I still keep in contact with. <BR />I hope this helps. I feel for you.

VAs many of you know I got manic a few weeks ago. but now it's progressed to psychosis and it's scaring the shit out me. <BR />Firstly I couldn't go to sleep because the voices were going to kill me. then I couldn't take my meds because they were poisoned. I couldn't eat because my food was poisoned. And now I'm terrified that there are satellites reading my thoughts so I  can't go outside. When my mood crashed back into depression the psychosis got worse. I'm so scared of everything right now. How can I make this paranoia go away. <BR />I was hospitalized because of the depression on Tuesday, but most of the doctors and nurses didn't believe me because this hasnt happened for years. <BR />I know I need to talk about this stuff with my therapist on Monday, but how do I cope til then.

V<P>Thanks everyone for the advice, I forgot to mention that her and this guy had a little moment last year where they hooked up a few times and then he told her that he loved her. But they sort of ignored that whole situation and moved on. He says he doesnt feel tat way for her anymore but I am not very close with him and I wouldnt know, and I doubt he would tell anyone else. But I imagine that it would pretty difficult to let go of those feelings and just move on and continue to be best friends with the girl you once loved. So everytime I see them I think of those moments and how he might still feel that way for her, this also fuels my jealousy.&nbsp;</P>

V<P><STRONG>Neg</STRONG>: Have been feeling very stressed and overwhelmed with TAFE work and assessments recently. It gets to the point where I think about dropping the course, but I never really look at what they would look like. I never truely think about it. I just continue on being stressed. Even finishing an assessment brings no relief anymore!&nbsp;</P>\u000a<P><STRONG>Pos</STRONG>: I know that not all the stress is because if TAFE &amp; Assessments, I know some is because of Family, Work, My health. I've not really thought about what dropping TAFE would look like because I made myself a promise to finish the course, I've committed myself to this, and one of my strengths is that when I've committed to something I don't back down too easily! I'm working on ways to destress. Music is a big one for me, and helps me calm. To beat the stress I can download a promotdo timer on my phone again and use that for studying, I found that to be helpful last year!</P>\u000a<P>&nbsp;</P>\u000a<P><STRONG>Neg</STRONG>: Learnt today, that I cannot trust many people at work. I told one colleague something I was thinking of, and next thing, the following day it's being talked about like it's fact. Feeling like it's just a gossip station. I already feel like I don't fit the community of workers, do I have to be the subject of talk too?</P>\u000a<P><STRONG>Pos</STRONG>: It wasn't my fault that people twist things. It's like chineese whispers. The item of discussion was something I wanted to have happen anyway, maybe just not right now with everything going on for me. Maybe after prac I can talk to the managers? I'm a minority among the community of staff, but I'm myself, and <FONT color="#0000FF"><STRONG>being true to myself is so much more important that fitting in</STRONG></FONT> there. I won't be there forever. It's a stepping stone to whatever I decide in the future! First doesn't have to mean last.</P>

I've found a lot of time during school to work on my writing (one of the big picture stories) during classes.

V<P><STRONG>Neg</STRONG>: Shut down in my psych apt today. Was overcome by anxiety, ended up in a panic attack. Found it incredibly hard to talk. I just wanted to curl up in a ball and cry. I was so scared to let her in.&nbsp;</P>\u000a<P><STRONG>Pos</STRONG>: I turned up! I stayed the full length of the appt! I tried to talk to her. I tried so hard to let her in.&nbsp;</P>\u000a<P>The psych was understanding and did her best to help me through it. She explained some things and made it seem a little less daunting. She gave me a breathing exercise to try everyday until our next apt. and she said to write down how it was, to share with her next week.</P>\u000a<P>&nbsp;</P>\u000a<P><STRONG>Neg</STRONG>: I feel bad because I wasn't able to open up to her and tell her what was really going on. It all just felt too hard.</P>\u000a<P><STRONG>Pos</STRONG>: I can always write it down and try to read it to her next week. Or I can just hand it to her.&nbsp;</P>\u000a<P>&nbsp;</P>\u000a<P><STRONG>Neg</STRONG>: Part of me is really scared to open up because everytime I've let people in before it has always come back to bite me on the bum. Like now, with things at work, with an old friend. I'm scared that someone will see me walk in, will see how long I've been at the chemist and know I'm seeing a psych. Part of me is so scared that people will judge me. Part of me I guess is scared of being judged by her. As that's all I've ever known. People I've been around in the past have not been accepting of mental health issues, has that scared me off??</P>\u000a<P><STRONG>Pos</STRONG>: I need to remember that what I share with her is bound by confidentiality! And that there's only 1 thing that can break that without my consent, which is in the event she is worried about my or someone elses safety! It doesn't make sense me being scared of her judging me, when this is the profession she's walked into, it's her job not to judge, but to listen and help me work through it.&nbsp;</P>\u000a<P>I don't have a positive for the fear of others judging me yet.</P>\u000a<P>&nbsp;</P>\u000a<P><STRONG>Neg</STRONG>: I'm worried about how I'm going to hide this from my mother. It felt so wrong to tell her TAFE ran late and that I then walked around shops looking for her b'day pressie. How am I going to hide it time after time? I don't want to let her in... But I also know that lying isn't the best, it'll eventually catch up with me.</P>\u000a<P><STRONG>Pos</STRONG>: I am trying really hard to not dwell on this, but to try and find reasons, or ways to work around this. I'm trying to come up with other ways to get through it/around it. I guss it'll all work out in the end.</P>

VThinking about sponsoring a child through The Smith Family and help a child you otherwise would go without things like school uniform and breakfast every morning. I just saw the article on Facebook and I couldn't help but think "Why don't I give back, and help someone else" because I know exactly what it is like to be one of those children, so why don't I use how far I have come to help others?

VI was going to start this by saying that I know how you must be feeling, but then I thought it would be right down ridiculous, because I cannot pretend to know what are you going through just judging by the message above. But I can tell you that I do know what is like to feel tired. I mean really, really tired. Like if nothing were important anymore, like nobody care. Like if this is never gonna change, what's the point?<BR />Well, I am going to tell you something. A bunch of years ago, when I was still on high school and my problems where more like how to get a good grade and not how to get through the day, I met someone who saved my life. Nor he nor I knew that by then, and I think he does not even know now. And you know how he saved my life? Well, believe it or not, he went through a rough crisis when I was 15 years, and he reached me out for help. But what can you do, being only a teenager, know nothing about depression, self-harm, suicidal thoughts? Nothing. So I did nothing: I just sat there and listened, to every single word, to every single broken thought. And he kept talking, and I kept listening, and oh boy, it hurt. It hurt like hell. I loved him more than I loved myself, and every time he was going throught crisis and he didn't pick up the phone, or he didn't open the door of his room, I panicked. I remember feeling that overwhelming feeling of despair.<BR />Eventually, he got over it. It took years, it took long talks and patience, it took treatments and long nights in silence. He is okay now. He doesn't have suicidal thoughts anymore. I do. I am not that 15 year girl anymore, I have grown up, and I have been through hell and back. Sometimes, things get heavy. I mean really heavy, if you know what I mean. Heavy enough to consider giving up. And you know why I haven't give up? Because I can remember how much it hurt. I remember the despair, the anger, I remember feeling helpless. I remember telling him over and over again how much he meant to me, how much I loved him, how much the single thought of not having him in my life anymore tore me into pieces. And above all, I remember him not believing me: just like you can't believe anyone right now when they tell you that they care, that you are going to be just fine: that it will pass, eventually. And that you will be happy for sticking around just a little bit longer to know it was truth.  <BR />Who knows? Maybe you meet someone if you hold on a bit more. It doesn't have to be a romantic relationship, it can be just simple and pure friendship. And then maybe, just like him did, you can get to save a life.<BR />

VHey there,<BR />I just wanted to add my two bobs worth.<BR />I got so far in my senior studies and was starting to second-guess myself. This was between submitting my uni preferences and exams looming. I went forward and said what ever happens happens. As it happened I got into the course I wanted in the place I didn't want. (if that makes sense) SO I chose to stay in my hometown and study locally. Even now, I have no idea where I WANT to go. I'm nearly convinced I'll be in a totally different sector to my studies. But it's not the end destination that matters but the journey.<BR />I've been to countless workshops where the speaker said the journey to where they were in that moment was by far the best. Because they got to experience all kinds of different work over so many years, and made so many awesome friendships. And it's some of those speakers which have helped me feel a bit better about not knowing what I want to do!<BR /><BR />By all means have a chat to your careers teacher, but remember that whatever you do, you should be choosing it because you want to <img class="emoticon emoticon-smileyhappy" id="smileyhappy" src="http://inspire.i.lithium.com/i/smilies/16x16_smiley-happy.png" alt="Smiley Happy" title="Smiley Happy" />

VI'm proud of me deciding to still go away despite today's footy incident - nothing is going to stop me having a good time. Also proud of myself for coming to terms with the fact that not every service can help me at the drop of a hat and I have to find ways to help myself before I rely on them, they need to be a second option. <BR />Proud of my little brother too.. We booked tickets for Alt J tonight (his bday present) but couldn't go, so we sold them and gave him the money. proud of him for taking it so well even though he was so excited to go.

V<P>Hey,<BR /><BR />I agree with everything blithe has said. There isn't one specific path that is the only helpful one. You can find a way to help people in basically any profession you do. You absolutely should not feel guilty about this.<BR /><BR />Go with whatever your gut tells you to in regards to university course. Don't feel like you need to make your decision and then that's it, you're stuck. Because really it's not like that at all. You can take subjects from a few different things. You can change courses in 6 months or a year, or 2 years, or whenever if you decide that it's not right for you.</P>

V<P>I've been feeling elevated lately. Finally got out of depression. I'm still struggling with uni, keeping myself focused. I'm so behind. I'm not quite sure if I can hand all my assignments on time. Or how much exam revision I can do before my exams. Keeping in mind my mood fluctuates, I feel really unfunctional when I'm depressed.&nbsp;</P>\u000a<P>&nbsp;</P>\u000a<P>I can't help but lose my focus, and my focus may deviates to other things like writing, thinking about my characters. daydreaming, shopping, singing, socialising etc. I also have a desire to do multiple things at once, its overwhelming, and I get lost. I want to do a lot of things, because I finally feel like I can do a lot during the course of my day. Sometimes I have the desire to move around the room, I have way too much energy, and I start bouncing like a bouncy ball. I've tried excercising, but I'm still restless, I have way too much energy in me, I don't know what to do with it.&nbsp;</P>\u000a<P>&nbsp;</P>\u000a<P>&nbsp;</P>

VNo but I am pretty friggin sick of my entire life at this point and my existence. I'm an 18 year old with only a few years of McDonalds on his resume, no friends, biggest joy in life is leaving the house to do any camera activites, can't write essays worth a damn, is scared of the dark (and outside world for that matter) Can't stay in environments all alone and feels like nightmares are important clues to mental health<BR /><BR />I feel like no one goves a crap about me. I bolted from my house in tears and nobody followed me or asked if I was alright when I returned. They knew I was leaving as I cried out. It was like it didn't happen.<BR /><BR />I could vanish and it wouldn't matter . I'm sorry for that. It's hurting inside so much <img class="emoticon emoticon-smileysad" id="smileysad" src="http://inspire.i.lithium.com/i/smilies/16x16_smiley-sad.png" alt="Smiley Sad" title="Smiley Sad" /><BR /><BR />The medication is no longer helping, I'm too depressed.

VHey <a href="http://forums.au.reachout.com/t5/user/viewprofilepage/user-id/6868">@sportyspice</a><BR /><BR />I relate well to what you're going through. I've often worried about how my mother will be once I've left home - she also has a few mental illnesses and even while I'm here she'll sometimes get into a state of not seeing a point in life.<BR /><BR />Is your mum currently seeking any help? If she is it'd be great if you could encourage her to keep up with her appointments and/or medication.<BR />If not it would be great if you could support her to get some help. Telling her about how this stuff makes you feel may be a good way to begin that.<BR /><BR />Could you perhaps make some suggestions on things to have her less lonely? See if there are any clubs or societies around the area that she could get involved in, or even suggesting online or speed dating? Both of those things have helped my mum improve by a ton.<BR /><BR />Another possibly option could be her getting something else to help her feel less like she's got an empty nest. Perhaps rescuing an animal? (Important point about this: Only if she's going to be able to properly care for the animal.)

V<P>Thanks for replying. I have to leave for training later and the team that I'm supposed to make to will be training on the courts next to us. I can't deal with the fact that I'm not making the team, much or less watch them train. Everytime they train I have to watch them and instead I picture myself playing on that team. I keep telling myself, "I should be there training with them," and then I look back and see I'm just watching from the sidelines. I just can't get the fact that I'm not in the team and I think I've reached my breaking point. I don't see where I've gone wrong either, all I've done was do all the right things and it never seems to go my way.&nbsp;</P>

I love creative writing, I find it therapeutic, relaxing and fun.&nbsp;</P>\u000a<P>&nbsp;</P>\u000a<P>I was going through my laptop today, going through my old poetry, my finished and non finished poetry. Unfortunately my most recent poems aren't finished yet. I often find myself working on more than one piece at once. I found this random mini poem.&nbsp;</P>\u000a<P>&nbsp;</P>\u000a<P><SPAN>Banana: </SPAN></P>\u000a<P><SPAN>I swung the banana, </SPAN></P>\u000a<P><SPAN>Until I saw is smiling back at me. </SPAN></P>\u000a<P><SPAN>For I was tired, </SPAN></P>\u000a<P><SPAN>Defeated and broken. </SPAN></P>\u000a<P><SPAN>I took a bite out of bliss, </SPAN></P>\u000a<P><SPAN>The banana savoured in my mouth. </SPAN></P>\u000a<P><SPAN>My world once again, </SPAN></P>\u000a<P><SPAN>Evolved into euphoria.</SPAN></P>\u000a<P>&nbsp;</P>\u000a<P>&nbsp;</P>

VI got a compliment from an elderly lady I served this week about my amazing customer service and bubbly personality. I helped her put her groceries into her shopping cart as she paid via eftpos. She was more than thrilled, and that compliment made my day! <img class="emoticon emoticon-smileyhappy" id="smileyhappy" src="http://inspire.i.lithium.com/i/smilies/16x16_smiley-happy.png" alt="Smiley Happy" title="Smiley Happy" />

VNegative: I still don't know what has happened the last 3 weeks. I feel dazed and detached from reality. I don't like the way I thought and acted during the mania, the paranoia, and the depressive crash. <BR /><BR />Positive: it doesn't have to akr complete sense, I got through it without self harming and I also got the help I needed. I'm proud of how I handle it despite how scared and confused I was <BR /><BR /><BR /><BR />Negative: I didn't feel I could talk to my therapist about it all. I just wanted to push it under the carpet and move on. <BR /><BR />Positive: we ended up talking about how I try to cover my feelings and experiences and pretend everything is fine until I explode. Another positive is that I see my psychiatrist on Wednesday and will feel more comfortable talking to him about it. <BR /><BR /><BR /><BR />Negative: my casemanager is away for the next few weeks so I don't have the extra support. I really needed her today and ended up taking myself to DEM because I couldn't cope and had no one to talk to. <BR /><BR />Positive: its only a few weeks. And I do have regular visits with my therapist and psychiatrist in the mean time. And there is always crisis lines or hospital if things get too out of control. <BR /><BR /><BR />

VI'm sorry I post on here a bit. I just have no motivation for anything anymore. I dont feel like associating with anyone, talking to my family and friends. Doing the things i love. I would rather stay in bed all day and sleep. <BR />I have been crying sooo much and i honestly dont know why.  Its frustrating me sooo much.

V<P>Hey <a href="http://forums.au.reachout.com/t5/user/viewprofilepage/user-id/6489">@DistancePerson</a>&nbsp;</P>\u000a<P>&nbsp;</P>\u000a<P>It's a tough road when you're looking out for a friend, and your friend is lucky to have you in their life. Everyone here has offered some great advice&nbsp;<img class="emoticon emoticon-smileyhappy" id="smileyhappy" src="http://inspire.i.lithium.com/i/smilies/16x16_smiley-happy.png" alt="Smiley Happy" title="Smiley Happy" /> Just here to add my 2 cents:&nbsp;</P>\u000a<P>&nbsp;</P>\u000a<P>What's also super important is taking care of yourself. Take some time out when you feel overwhelmed or set boundaries if you feel that you need to. Don't ever push yourself well beyond your limits or what makes you feel uncomfortable.&nbsp;</P>\u000a<P>&nbsp;</P>\u000a<P>I can definitely relate to what you're feeling right now about 'what if something bad happens if I'm not there?'.&nbsp;For the past three years, I've been looking out for one particular friend with severe depression. I was the go-to friend, from phone calls, FB messages, and the getaway vehicle driver when she was not feeling ok. It got to a point where I became rather bitter, and just could not do it anymore - particularly since she grew to become very ungrateful and aggressive. But I found that talking to other people (i.e professionals like GPs, a psychologist, a counsellor or a community worker) has been useful to build a support network for myself and a safety net for her.&nbsp;</P>\u000a<P>&nbsp;</P>\u000a<P>Do you think that confiding in other supportive people (such as pros) could be a good way to go in looking out for her?It's all about making a team effort, so you're not alone in this.&nbsp; If she just likes talking to you, that's great. Even if you feel that it's useless, at least you know that in your own way, you can support her during tough times.&nbsp;</P>

I would look at the suggestions but I forget my troubles to the point where I've forgotten stuff like that.<BR /><BR />Anyway I feel like that myself and the people around me would be happier if I kept my stupid mouth shut. <BR /><BR />I feel like "myself" has gotten me nowhere and isnt worth anything. I just slowly dig a grave where and more people see the true me and hate it. Someone told me that I should disappear. <BR /><BR />I'm just so emotionally lost to the point where I'm back at square one. I'm just not happy ya know?<BR /><BR /><BR />Sorry for the rant, if anyone was offended I'll remove the post

VI hate this frustration. I can't let this all go. I can't find the words. I can't cry or scream. I feel silent. Its so fucking tiring. I hate depression. On top of feeling depressed I've been ruminating over the past (which I do a lot when I'm in depressed phase). I cannot change it, yet I cannot let go, its intensifying my depressive feelings. When I fall, its like like life takes a turn and it all comes crashing and burning, and I cannot stop myself from spiraling downwards.

V<P>So I went to the doctor today. She said I'm insulting professionals. But I don't understand her reasoning. She thinks I'm not working hard enough, she thinks I'm lazy. I'm still trying, I guess she doesn't understand how hard life when you're a human yo yo. If it was the case, why would I reach out for support? Why am I still alive even? Why can't I be picky over which psych and psychiatrist I want to see? I mean, you don't connect to people straight away. Even at first, she was apprehensive to refer me to anyone, because she thinks I can't work with people. So I didn't respond to the psychiatrist and psychologist treatment I received last year automatically means I will never find it helpful. Or the fact she said, I'm the most difficult patient, and the only one who never responded to treatment at uni.&nbsp;</P>\u000a<P>&nbsp;</P>\u000a<P>It's like being on a battlefield, it just keeps getting messier and messier. I'm still thinking of how I'm going to tell her to refer me to another GP. Because I'm wasting my time, and its only making it worse, I can't keep seeing her. I can't see my old one, because sadly she left. I want a understanding and empathetic doctor.&nbsp;</P>\u000a<P>&nbsp;</P>

They're surely used to people who have issues with phones, and if it's brought up I can mention that I have issues with calling people.

V<P>There is perhaps one comment on this page that isn't entirely useless. Did it ever occur to anyone that this isn't a deep rooted emotion in my mind but a fear that has been caused by the article. By saying that a change that might happen would be beyond my control and that I can't do anything about it? Why does everyone take the easy way out and assume it was already there? No it wasn't, this was casued by an article which led me to believe a change would occur beyond my control. Before that I had zero doubts about myself but I allowed an article to undermine it. That is what happened. The only decent advice I got was from another site, they said I was overthinking a new concept and being too hard on myself. To be honest that has made the most sense out of everything I have heard.</P>

VHello there <a href="http://forums.au.reachout.com/t5/user/viewprofilepage/user-id/6833">@animallady</a> and welcome to ReachOut. <BR /><BR />Have you spoken to your husband about this? Making sure the people close to you know what's going on can help them better help you. Also, how does your husband react when you verbally abuse him? <BR /><BR />I've gone through a similar thing myself. Where the slightest thing would send me into a rage or nothing at all. I would yell for a bit, slam and/or hit a few things then storm into my room, sit on my bed and cry because I was angry and sad at myself for loosing my temper. It was an annoying cycle that I wanted to break, and sometimes it still comes back but less often now. <BR />What I did was trying to identify what it was exactly that was causing the anger. Not the actual event (something insignificant) but why it was making me anger. What exactly I was annoyed at, usually it would be one of my siblings, they would have done something (the insignificant thing) and they would have been doing something that annoyed me and I would be angry at them, not the thing. Did that make sense? <BR />Basically, I would be angry at whoever did the thing instead of the thing itself. <BR /><BR />Once I identified what it was I was angry at, what I was really angry at, I used this to try and calm myself down. I focused on my breathing and exited the room without shouting or slamming or stomping. <BR /><BR />Things you can do when you feel the anger coming depend on whose around you. The first thing you always do is focus on your breathing. You can deep breaths or normal breaths but focus on the counts, how long you breath in, hold and then let out. Counting slowly to ten while deep breathing. Either works. The next thing is that you leave the room (if there's someone else in there) or if it's where the problem is. You want to make sure you are as far away from the problem, the cause, as you realistically can. <BR />Another thing you can do, if your husband is okay with it and if you think it would help, is go to him and talk with him. Just let him know you're feeling angry and talk with him about something. Do a lazy activity, watch a movie, listen to music, go for a walk. <BR /><BR /><BR />Talking to someone is very important, and also work out some strategies in advance. Breathing, talking, walking, whatever it is, work out what you'll do if you feel angry before it happens so that when it does, you are prepared. <BR /><BR />Best of luck!

VHey DistancePerson,<BR /><BR />A couple of years ago I broke down in a maths test. I'm sure I would have broken down in more, but I ended up mostly trying to then avoid them.<BR />There was a lot going on for me, so I was missing a lot of the content at school. <BR />I remember going into that test thinking that I'd be fine since I did this theory the year before. I looked at the paper, I started, and almost none of it made any sense to me. I had forgotten everything. Other things I wasn't sure I'd ever known.<BR />It seemed like everyone else around was so content and sure in what they were doing, and the room was so quiet that my tears seemed all the more difficult to hide from myself, my teacher, or my class.<BR /><BR />Tests are stressful. Tests when we've got a lot of other things going on are stressful. Tests when we don't know or understand the thing we're being tested on are stressful.<BR />It's okay for you to have broken down.<BR />It's also okay to ask for help in any form that you need it. - If this is with the content of the test, you can maybe ask your teacher/a friend to clarify some things, or see if you can get a tutor. If it's the stuff surrounding the test, speaking to your teacher or a school counsellor could allow a change in environment or even in the task itself. If it's about things largely unrelated to the test then asking for some help in those areas (here, to your parents, counsellors, friends etc.) is probably a great idea.<BR /><BR />Maybe school and maths aren't meant to be your priority right now. Maybe you need to think about finding a way to speak to your parents (perhaps a letter?) about some things that you've been meaning to speak to them about? It sounds like this is a thing that you'd really like to be different. It's very likely that your parents would love for it to be more like how you'd like it to be too.

I have a few places I'd like to live. Jan Juc is one of them, it's my favourite place in the world - if it wasnt super expensive I'd move there. I love Melbourne - maybe there is another way of letting go of those memories and things I don't want to face, rather than running from them.&nbsp;</P>

VHey Bee<BR /><BR />I am so happy that you've had your first appointment!! Very well done!<BR /><BR />I get that the appointment didn't go the way you wanted it to, but I want you to know that your reaction was completely fine and normal. I'm sure she's really used to people being in similar states on first appointments.<BR />Several of my psychologists have told me about how they're actually more used to people coming in who then don't talk for the session, or barely talk. So please don't feel embarrassed about it or anything, it's fine. <BR /><BR />Perhaps bringing up worries about medication would be a good way to start talking a bit more? Since it's a topic that's already on the table. It's certainly a thing to consider and a worthwhile thing to ask questions about until you're comfortable with a decision to take not take it. <BR /><BR />Blood tests can be scary. Make sure you drink a lot of water on that day - it will help a lot.

V<a href="http://forums.au.reachout.com/t5/user/viewprofilepage/user-id/4683">@Creativegirl12</a> I can relate. Have you tried using mindfulness when the thoughts start going round. I know how hard it can be to break the cycl. but just watching the thoughts go by and let them be, don't judge them, accept them and move forward. It's a hard process but it can help.

If that doesnt work, I&nbsp;start talking about random stuff till I feel&nbsp;comfortable enough to start talking about why I'm there. Sometimes I spent several sessions doing that till I could jump straight into dealing with the issue at the sart of the session. In terms of coping afterwards I need to go for a long walk and slowly ease my way back into things as it can feel quite disorienting to go straight from counselling to uni/work, which is why I book appointments after uni so I have the time to destress. Writing stuff down really helps too.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</P>\u000a<P>&nbsp;</P>\u000a<P>If you are ready to tell them something, you'll know. For me, it came down to the strength of&nbsp;the relationship. If&nbsp;I felt they didnt understand, I would wait until they had built&nbsp;enough of a relationship for&nbsp;me to feel comfortable&nbsp;revealing whatever it was.&nbsp;Sometimes&nbsp;you might not feel comfortable&nbsp;to reveal it for several sessions.&nbsp;Don't feel pressured by the time limit either. You are there for you and no one else. As for how to reveal it, that's up to you.&nbsp;Has she explained how you can contact her outside the sessions? Some make themselves available via email or phone, which may make it easier to reveal the issue. I find drawing,&nbsp;leavng a message or writing it down really helpful.&nbsp;You&nbsp;dont have to reveal it all in one session either. You can take as long as you need</P>\u000a<P>&nbsp;</P>\u000a<P>As for building yourself up,&nbsp;the hardest part is believing&nbsp;in yourself enough to get help, which your doing. Self talk really helps. Try to remind yourself that&nbsp;you have just as much right to seek help as&nbsp;anyone else.&nbsp;</P>\u000a<P>&nbsp;</P>\u000a<P>It&nbsp;may be hard to imagine now, but it does&nbsp;get easier with time <img class="emoticon emoticon-smileyhappy" id="smileyhappy" src="http://inspire.i.lithium.com/i/smilies/16x16_smiley-happy.png" alt="Smiley Happy" title="Smiley Happy" />&nbsp;</P>\u000a<P>&nbsp;</P>\u000a<P>I hope that made sense.&nbsp;If not, let me know <img class="emoticon emoticon-smileyhappy" id="smileyhappy" src="http://inspire.i.lithium.com/i/smilies/16x16_smiley-happy.png" alt="Smiley Happy" title="Smiley Happy" /></P>\u000a<P>&nbsp;</P>

A good start is your GP, and I get how hard it is, so maybe think about the doctor you have seen regularly or over the course of a little while, not a brand new person cause &nbsp;that can be pretty damn scary when you're first opening up about stuff. &nbsp;</P>\u000a<P>I've got a small number of mental health issues and I hear voices when during particularly bad times, so I do know how it feels. The first time or when they are fairly new it is terrifying.&nbsp;</P>\u000a<P>You are certainly not alone. If you're not sure about going to your GP just yet, maybe think about discussing it with eheadspace or KHL? I know I just said it's scary talking to a new person about this sort of thing but you can acess their services online, so its much less daunting. And you know what? eheadspace can actually HELP you set up an appointment with your doctor, they are really helpful with that sort of thing. So if you can't talk to your doctor just yet thats ok, but I really urge you to at least get in contact with eheadspace. Thinking of you mate, you're not alone.&nbsp;</P>\u000a<P>Links to both services.&nbsp;</P>\u000a<P><A href="https://www.eheadspace.org.au" target="_self" rel="nofollow">eheadspace</A></P>\u000a<P><A href="http://www.kidshelp.com.au/teens/" target="_self" rel="nofollow">Kids Helpline</A></P>\u000a<P>&nbsp;</P>\u000a<P>&nbsp;</P>\u000a<P>&nbsp;</P>\u000a<P>&nbsp;</P>\u000a<P>&nbsp;</P>\u000a<P>&nbsp;</P>

VHey,<BR /><BR />Often we can be really good at ignoring our problems and putting others before ourselves. Sometimes even just as a distraction or because it's easier to think about other people.<BR />I'm wondering if you're getting any help for your OCD? It may be worth having a chat to them about how you're feeling as they may be able to offer up some ways to take care of yourself amongst the other people.<BR />If the people around you aren't really aware of what you're going through it would also be great if you were able to share it a bit with them. That way they either will be more considerate of what they're putting on you or you can both sort of share each others burdens.

V<P>Hey,<BR /><BR />Everyone else has given you some great and important advice and information that I'm not going to repeat.<BR /><BR />I just wanted to say that one of the best things you can do for this friend is exactly what you are doing - being there for her and not judging. I'm sure she finds it a great relief and comfort to know that she has you.<BR />You should let her know how important she is to you and don't be afraid to let her know about how you'd feel if anything happened to her. If there is a time of crisis where you're not available for any reason it could be a really nice comfort or motivation to know that you care, and you want her here, and that you even rely on her too. <BR />But, try not to do that in any way that should be making her feel guilty for coming to you or for anything that happens.</P>\u000a<P>Letting her know this and be aware that you do want to help may also let her give you some idea on what she needs/wants from you. For example maybe she really just needs to rant to you rather than being given advice, or maybe she wants you to distract her.<BR /><BR />And I want to reiterate the point that anything that does happen - steps backwards, decisions not to get help etc. is not your fault, not something to blame yourself for, and not something that you have to carry alone. <BR />You need to make sure you take care of yourself. These situations can be really hard and stressful for the person in your position - and it's completely okay to feel a bit drained or swallowed up by it. Feeling like you can't take it doesn't make you a bad friend or a bad person. It just means that it's a really big issue that may need more help.</P>

V<P>Well sure, but only the "just coping" thing works. Eg. last time things were particularly bad I tried exercise and writing crap down- it wasn't until awhile after I'd stopped doing those things that I felt significantly better, so there's no correlation between the two. To me it suggests that the only solution is to just push harder and stay effective, because anything else is weak and doesn't do jack all.</P>

V<P>I've never read this before - thanks for sharing such a powerful letter! Although self-harm isn't the best way of coping with things, it doesn't mean you're weak or a terrible person if you find yourself struggling with it. The way I see it, it just means you're on a journey trying to deal with your emotions in whatever way you can. Sometimes it takes time to learn better ways. And then saying goodbye to those old, unhelpful ways of coping takes an awesome amount of strength <img class="emoticon emoticon-smileyhappy" id="smileyhappy" src="http://inspire.i.lithium.com/i/smilies/16x16_smiley-happy.png" alt="Smiley Happy" title="Smiley Happy" /></P>\u000a<P>&nbsp;</P>\u000a<P>Always remember: you're braver than you believe, stronger than you seem and smarter than you think <img class="emoticon emoticon-smileywink" id="smileywink" src="http://inspire.i.lithium.com/i/smilies/16x16_smiley-wink.png" alt="Smiley Wink" title="Smiley Wink" /></P>

VHi, thanks for the advice and the welcome. I'm not exactly sure what causes my angry outbursts but all I know is when it starts I can't stop. If I'm standing near something, for example, a cupboard, a lounge, a table I usually end up hitting it with my fists and having a complete melt down. Sounds childish I know but that's how I seem to be dealing with this. I am stressed all the time and feel quite withdrawn from anything, I get up in the morning, go to work, come home from work, get dinner, go to bed and then do it all again the next day. Nothing changes. I spend most of my time in my bedroom watching tv or reading, anything to stay away from my husband because I don't want to lash out, makes me sound like a bitch but I just don't know what else to do!  I try to talk to him but he doesn't take anything seriously so it's pointless even trying.

VWell done on going to the doctor to talk about this! <BR /><BR />Doctors are more like a gateway to professional help than help itself. They can certainly decide to make their own call and can prescribe you medication, but of themselves that's basically as far as it goes.They're not trained mental health professionals. They're trained a little bit, but they haven't specialised in mental health and after so long away from their training they've likely forgotten a lot of the information or they're not up to date with information. This is why he didn't give you a proper diagnosis or any actual counselling. <BR />The only doctors trained to do such things are psychiatrists - they train as doctors (go to medical school) and then specialise in psychiatry in order to become psychiatrists. <BR /><BR />It is absolutely worth the fears of going. Being afraid of going, and also doing what you're currently doing of wondering whether it'll help or if you're meant to recover or if this is just how you are is a very normal response to this all. Part of it (quite possibly a very big part) is going to be due to your mental health. It doesn't want you to recover, or you're so used to it that you don't really imagine a you without it. I was the same. Anxiety was such a big part of how I saw myself, it was part of what made me 'me'. And to some extent I didn't see it as an actual problem - it was just like a quirk that I'd grow out of or live with like anything else.<BR />But, it really was a problem. It still is a problem - I do still have it, but it's a way smaller problem. It doesn't stop me from doing things anywhere near the extent it used to. I'm not even sure that the majority of my responses or thoughts come from a place of unhealthy anxiety anymore.<BR />When I was seeing mental health professionals, particularly psychologists seemed to help for me, I didn't really feel like I was getting much help in the moment. But stuff that has happened in sessions from 5 years ago still comes back to me or I will realise I'm doing the things I was taught.<BR />Even in the moment when I didn't feel like it was doing anything, it's so nice to have more of an understanding of what's going on with you - which is something they'll give you. And I felt with each of my psychologists that they legitimately cared about me and wanted to help. I don't think I can adequately express how helpful that was in retrospect. To feel like you do have someone in your corner.

V<P>So today we found that the artworks we make are going to be put into an exhibition in a few weeks. I really didn't want mine displayed so I approached my teacher and asked if I could not include mine and the response seriously pissed me off.....</P>\u000a<P>&nbsp;</P>\u000a<P>He goes all stern and says that I must "You're a art student, do you not think you are expected to do this. If you have a problem you can see the head teacher or write your full complaint in a letter" He knows about my aniexty so I'm angry that he decided to go all stern and angry like that, he barely asked why I didn't want it shown.</P>\u000a<P>&nbsp;</P>\u000a<P>So I approached the head teacher, I explained I didn't want it up for "personal reasons". The head teacher acts shocked but still says that if I really don't want to do it I don't have to but it would be great if I could and to speak to her tomorrow. The head teacher was friendly though, I have no problem with how she acted and I feel okay about speaking with her.</P>\u000a<P>&nbsp;</P>\u000a<P>I'm kinda annoyed, I'm not changing my mind, their have been study days I've been though were I go "never again" and this time I'm putting my foot down. I know my teacher will definately not respond well when I go back tomorrow</P>\u000a<P>&nbsp;</P>\u000a<P>P.S This exhibition has nothing to do with our HSC or anything really important</P>

Listening to music, going for a walk/run talking to someone, reading or something distracting like tv can help. It might not take the voices away but if can help drown them out. <BR /><BR />As <a href="http://forums.au.reachout.com/t5/user/viewprofilepage/user-id/4265">@Chessca_H</a> said it would be really helpful to see your doctor or a psychiatrist about the voices. Medication and therapy really does help. I'm on meds that drastically reduce my voices, I used to have them every day, but now I only get them when I'm stressed. <BR /><BR />Hang in there mate

V@Talitha it can be daunting talking to someone you don't know well. It always takes time to build up trust. It can be discouraging if you've had bad experiences, it does happen unfortunately. It can take some time before you find someone you click with. It is possible to find someone you can click with. Would you be willing to give in another go?

At first my GP was apprehensive to refer me, then she sort of was told to do it. I was in a really bad place during my last depressive episode, and people were concerned of my safety. Today my GP referred me to another psychologist. She wants me to see a psychiatrist, though I'm not sure she's done the referral for it yet. The last psychologist sort of pre-rejected me. I got a phone call the other day, I guess I have a pretty crappy medical record. I'm &nbsp;put off from seeing her anyways. It's not the best way to start a psychologist-client relationship. Having ideas of each other before we've even met. <BR /><BR /><a href="http://forums.au.reachout.com/t5/user/viewprofilepage/user-id/1388">@Myvo</a> I have an app with her just in case and with another doc next week. I've told her I'm willing to try again, i.e. seeing a psychologist and psychiatrist. I still have my psychologist app. Hoping that it works out this time.</P>

VNeg: Looking at the time just before made me a little anxious. Getting closer to me starting work today. I don't like this feeling.<BR />Pos: I know this is just a usual routine for me. The anxiety is manageable. I just keep telling myself that there is nothing at work which can harm me. My colleagues are good to work with, mostly to distract me. I can always ask my supervisor if there's another job I can do today if I'm not in express. If not I can make the most of express by reminding myself most interactions are only a few minutes. I can remind myself HOW many times I've gone to work feeling anxious and finished the shift feeling ok. <BR /><BR />Neg: Starting to get worried and nervous about my psych apt on Monday.<BR />Pos: She knows a bit about me already (thanks to eheadspace) which should help if I feel really anxious. She's probably used to dealing with anxious clients - I mean it is apart of her job! I'm going there to get help - to find ways to feel better. It's ok to feel anxious about it, it's not necessarily a bad thing<BR /><BR />Neg: Part of me feeling rather anxious/nervous because she spoke with Eheadspace. I'm kinda scared about what was said... So many other thoughts &amp; questions.<BR />Pos: I wanted that to occur. I can always ask Eheadspace what info she passed on... I know that what info eheadspace passed on would have been to help me, I have gained a sense of trust working with this clinician which is why I asked her. I guess my main fear is the unknown.

VLoving all these awkward moments! Making me smile guys!<BR /><BR />So I had a very awkward moment today.<BR />I came out oft he office with my till and saw a line up of customers, so as I walked to my register, I called a number of them down to follow me. As I went to put my till in, the register wouldn't let me log in, and I then realized someone else had their will in.. SO I apologized to the customers and went and double checked were I was meant to be. I was in number 3 not 4. So the poor customer had to repack his basket and bring it around to number 3 so I could serve him. It was really embarrassing.<BR /><BR />My other one today was I was helping a colleague fetch the trolley's because it was really quiet. and on my first run I took down 5 or 6, and left one at the top of the ramp, which my male colleague took with him. Then on my second lot to bring in, I left two behind, but they were already half on the slope and started racing towards me like a speed bullet! I was scared I was about to be run over by run away trolley's! haha I was puffed trying to keep up with the trolley's and nearly fell over at the bottom trying to steer them away from our glass sliding doors!

V<P>My life: is a constant cycle between feeling sane for a short amount of time and feeling depressed, unwell and barely above water. I drink to cope. I am alone for most of the time, my partner works a lot, so I have plenty of time to wallow.<BR /><BR />I'm at the age where I thought I would be past this feeling... low self esteem, drinking to cope... &nbsp;To make things even better, I don't have a strong social group due to relocation. All my friends are either very busy or transient, and I've successfully&nbsp;had 3 falling outs with people whom I considered my closest friends in the last 3 years, due to differences of opinion of how I should have conducted myself (not-drinking related).... Attempting to grow into myself and be myself seems to always be met with disappointment and rejection. I'm constantly struggling to feel secure, and&nbsp;to find someone who will&nbsp;to stand up for me, and understands me. I didn't have it in my childhood and it seems to be what I am forever looking for now. I am different, I know that now... looking back, everything I did and how I learned, was all different. I wonder if I have a form of Asperges. It would explain a lot. I feel it everyday, people find my awkward and overly confident, but really I'm so vulnerable and desperate to make any connection.<BR /><BR />Despite all of my best intentions,&nbsp;it is never any different... this seems to be my pattern in life. True connections are never made. I am so truly lonely. In my heart, I feel so alone.&nbsp;I keep waiting for the inevitable doom, where my life collapses, I lose my job and my husband and I have an excuse to say fuck it all, you got what you wanted, I'll leave you all in peace and just disappear to an isolated place and become a nobody. There's so much less pressure when you're a nobody.<BR /><BR />I'm writing this because I DO want to see the light at the end of the tunnel. I definitely find comfort in feeling low and feeling the effects of alcohol/drugs.... it makes me feel like someone else, and takes the pressure off my shoulders. I just am so angry that this is the life I've been dealt and that makes me resilient to change... why can't I just be normal? Why can't I just be likeable? Why doesn't anybody like me? Geez that's a horrible feeling.... it's entirely worse to begin to accept it and let it become you. Me: the unlikeable person.</P>

V<P>Hey! I thought I'd just say that you're strong, and the fact that you're trying to stop self harming is a great start.</P>\u000a<P>My way of coping is making little origami paper stars. I put them in a jar, and when I fill the jar up, I empty it into a box and start again. I have a huge pile of paper strips on my desk, and whenever I get an urge to self harm I make stars until it goes away. Obviously there is no coping mechanism that is 100% ffective at making you stop, but this really helps me.</P>\u000a<P>If you don't know how to make them, I learnt from this video <A href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FDDvYwb-D44" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FDDvYwb-D44</A> (Nothing really happens until about 0.55, so I would probably skip to there.)</P>\u000a<P>&nbsp;</P>\u000a<P>Hope this helps! xx</P>

VIt feels like I have the right words or advice for people but I can't help myself. <BR />My self harm is getting more frequent, I can't even go a week without needing medical attention. Yet even when I'm in the emergency room I'm here giving advice to other people. (Im not saying that's bad of wrong tho) <BR />I'm falling apart. I can barely stay out of the psych ward. I can't take my own advice. Every day I wish I was dead. I just can't cope with all this, but most of the time I'm too scared to ask for help until it's too late.

I've tried distracting myself and engaging in other things, but it can be so hard especially when you're so trapped in thoughts. <BR /><BR />I need to find a way to express the untold stuff inside me, maybe writing. I still go back and I hurt over it. It really gets to me when I'm depressed, and it aggravates it. I've tried writing this poem about it but my creativity died so I never finished it.

V<a href="http://forums.au.reachout.com/t5/user/viewprofilepage/user-id/214">@Birdeye</a> &amp; @Sophie-RO Thank you. I'm seeing it as a bit more of an achievement tonight. I had a chat with eheadspace tonight so it's feeling a little more real.<BR /><BR />Soph, you're right, I could have, I also could have declined the call like I did earlier that afternoon! I just kept thinking, I really need to answer this, I knew I needed to change something - Like I mentioned in the email I sent her.<BR /><BR />Birdeye, I guess it's never been a strong suit of mine - phones, but I'm kinda ok with that. Maybe one day it'll be easier...<BR /><BR /><BR />So from here, my clinician at Eheadspace is going to ring the psych next week to pass on some information. I'm a little nervous about what exactly she is going to say...

OR, I pause for a couple of minutes and then loose track of time, get distracted. OR I've lost focus and my motivation is gone. <BR />What I'm working on is a number of projects. Before it was a presentation for a meeting but I also have a book I've been working on and another number of short (or not so short) stories with this program Zen Writer.

V<P>It helps a little to be out of my room. This semester has definitely been the most challenging. I'll see what I can do. Thanks for all the support guys. I've been irritable/angry due to stress and mood swings.&nbsp;</P>\u000a<P>&nbsp;</P>\u000a<P>I'm trying to sort out my academics, because unfortunately its hard to get assignments in on time. One of my assignments was extended twice, haven't handed it in, and it was due yesterday and its not close to being done. <BR /><BR /><BR />It's almost end of semester, just before exams. I'll see if I can do these units later without penalty. I'm not entirely sure if they would accept severe depression (its more intense than it used to be) as a reason to discontinue and try again later. I'm pretty sure my studies don't help my mood swings. <BR /><BR /><BR />Mood swing=lack of concentration, lack of concentration=frustration=worse mood swings. <BR /><BR /><BR />My psychologist is working on my diagnosis at the moment (I know she's working out if I have a mood disorder), and we will work on how I can cope better with my mood being all over the place.</P>

Are the people close to you fully aware of your problems with OCD? Sounds like you are an extremely caring person who puts people before yourself- but perhaps when things get all too much you might have to explain to some people that you need to care for yourself first and take a break for a while. Hope this helps, here for you and hope things settle down a little for you <img class="emoticon emoticon-smileyhappy" id="smileyhappy" src="http://inspire.i.lithium.com/i/smilies/16x16_smiley-happy.png" alt="Smiley Happy" title="Smiley Happy" /></P>

I'm not bummed out about it being a waste of time (ie. right now it's not upsetting because this is calm detached mode), but it is just legitimately a waste of time. What works is just to put up with whatever until it goes away on its own. If things aren't good then they're just going to stay not good until they're randomly good again and vice versa. It's just what it is, whether i try to change anything or not.&nbsp;</P>\u000a<P>&nbsp;</P>\u000a<P>But whatevs, I can do some + - about other stuff.</P>

I've had a  really a rough day. It's been overwhelming lately. I feel mentally drained. Like I need a good long break. Fighting through depression is so hard. <BR /><BR />There are other factors  that aren't helping me with intensity of depression. One of them being uni pressure is sort of aggravating the situation further. It's kind of hard to keep up with everything. Which in turn makes me feel stressed and more depressed because I feel like I've failed. It makes me want to drop out. <BR /><BR /><a href="http://forums.au.reachout.com/t5/user/viewprofilepage/user-id/3030">@blithe</a> from your question on the other thread I've been in contact with lifeline for my suicidal thoughts.

But it's been so hard, and I have ehadspace and everyone here to thank. You guys are always encouraging me and helping me push forward. I really appreciate everything!<BR /><BR />I should have mentioned it, but I was acting in fear and self-protection I guess. I was actually scared that if I said that other bit it would have turned into a duty of care scenario and added to the seriousness of my case...

I'm proud of myself for not trying to be 'brave' and fight all the way through my shift. That I decided to look after myself.

V<P>So I am in year 12 and pretty soon we have to make university choices. For about a year and half now I have been pretty set on studying a course that helps underprivileged people, and whenever someone has asked me what I want to do when I leave school I have told them that. But lately I have been unsure of some of my decisions, I regret some of my subject choices in school, I wish I chose some that would help me in life, like legal, business maangement or economics and I feel I have let myself down. This has lead me to the thought that maybe the university course I have chosen is not for me either and that I am making a big mistake by choosing it, but by not chosing it and not going into a profession that helps underprivileged people I feel as though I am letting them down and that I should feel guilt for choosing not to help them. I don't necessary know what anyone could say to this but I just needed somewhere to write my feelings.</P>

VHey @ChelsyMaree many of us have gone through troubles in school, and I hope our experiences help you with yours. <BR /><BR />@MemphisBell is right too, be sure to stand your ground. Don't tell the teachers, but all school really does is give you a mark so you can get into university or whatever you choose. It's a stepping stone to getting a job.

It wouldn't be there if it weren't for these forums!! Especially some members from the old forums way back when &amp; everyone here now&nbsp;&amp; of course&nbsp;<a href="http://forums.au.reachout.com/t5/user/viewprofilepage/user-id/52">@Sophie-RO</a>!!</P>\u000a<P>&nbsp;</P>\u000a<P>I had my second apt today. I had to wait about 20min to see her as she was running late, which in turn I think made the apt shorter, but that's ok. Today was much better than last week. I've still got a long way to go in terms of really trusting and opening up, but in saying that I am able to work with her. I acualy managed to make eye contact today and hold it for short periods of time!! AND I managed to SPEAK! So I want to thank you all for sticking with me and all your encouagement and support. You've all played a huge role in helping me get here!</P>\u000a<P>&nbsp;</P>\u000a<P>I walked out today feeling okay. She is actually understanding and listening to me, which I've not had anyone do in such a long time (face to face that is.) And despite a couple things I really struggled to explain or get out, she seemed to understand. And when I stumbled on my words trying to get it out, she didn't judge. She just waited for me, when I was ready. And on my own I was trying to calm myself and focus my attention so I could get it out. It all seems like stock standard stuff for a psychologist, but it's something I've not had in my life. Basic things like someone taking the time to really listen, being patient with me, and waiting until the resistence wears thin so I can talk.</P>\u000a<P>&nbsp;</P>\u000a<P>From here there's a lot going on. The psych is going to contact my TAFE teacher and find out what support can be accessed, because she thinks I need it and it'd help me cope better. I'm kinda nervous about that, but the same time we've discussed it and I'm hapy for her to do so. From there, she will also write a letter to my gp asking for some blood tests and a script for medication. Which in all honesty, as scared as I am about it, I kinda knew that it would mount to it so quickly, just because of how I've felt internally for so long, because despite all my efforts, I never really feel like I get anywhere. But it's doable I guess.&nbsp;I'm trusting her judgement and knowledge to help me because I don't know how to get out of it myself...</P>\u000a<P>&nbsp;</P>\u000a<P>But to re-answer&nbsp;<a href="http://forums.au.reachout.com/t5/user/viewprofilepage/user-id/52">@Sophie-RO</a>'s question, yes I can see myself connecting with her. She's got a good balance between serisousness and humor, which helps to break it up a little bit.</P>

Leaving for Marakoopa tomorrow night so we have a whole day to just hang around and check the place out here. Met some new mates today and we're about to have pizza for dinner with them.

V<P><STRONG>Neg</STRONG>: Feeling a bit fragile today. Kinda like there is too much going on inside my head to fully understand. Wanting to just live my life with only me running it for once. Feeling controlled by my parents, feeling like I can't stand up to them and tell them to back off, to lay off the expectations, to lay off me wanting to do thiings for them, mum especially. I'm just getting really tired of never being able to have time alone for myself to figure things out myself. Wanting to move out already!</P>\u000a<P><STRONG>Pos</STRONG>: There is a lot going on inside my head right now, I am going to try some journaling later tonight - when I lay on the ground and throw out millions of coloured pens and textas to expres myself! I'm not sure on the whole parent thing, I'll think of some strategiest o try in my journalling. I am looking at moving out at the end of the year. I need that time to find my feet.</P>\u000a<P>&nbsp;</P>\u000a<P><STRONG>Neg</STRONG>: Felt really anxious when running into a parent from the last centre I did prac at (she's also a psychologist). Part of me felt though like talking, but it had been so long since I last spoke to her I had no clue what to say. I also didn't feel like talking. I wanted to go home and be alone. &nbsp;</P>\u000a<P><STRONG>Pos</STRONG>: Part of me felt like talking because it was so easy to talk to her while on prac. I did end up talking to her, she updated me on her daughters condition they were trying to figure out when I was there. It was a good chat. By the end I understood why I had that inclination to stop and chat.&nbsp;</P>\u000a<P>&nbsp;</P>\u000a<P><STRONG>Neg:</STRONG> Now I'm once again confused. Do I try to gain contact with her again, or do I try with pref #2 who I emailed over easter? I'm Feeling all so blood confused about the whole damn thing. I just don't know why it all has to be so hard!? I don't even know what I want. It feels like talking to her will be harder than I thought, maybe I over simplified it in my head? Maybe I'm over-complicating it now? What am I to do? Why do I alway have to question everything???&nbsp;</P>\u000a<P><STRONG>Pos</STRONG>: I can always try tomorrow, see which one I end up calling first? I have an aptointment with eheadsapce sometime this week, I can talk it over with them. I can do some journalling to see what I think would be best for me. Given everything right now.</P>\u000a<P>&nbsp;</P>\u000a<P><STRONG>Neg</STRONG>: Feeling really numb right now. Kind of just wanting to sef-medicate. Nothing seems to feel normal anymore. I feel like each day I start in a pit of despair, and that's where I end up in the end, never managing to escapse the sameness of my pit of despair - nothing feels good anymore.</P>\u000a<P><STRONG>Pos</STRONG>: I'm aware the urge to self-medicate. I can manage the outcome of this. &nbsp;I'm becoming aware of some of these feelings running around inside me, thus meaning I can try to work out some strategies to cope through them.</P>\u000a<P>&nbsp;</P>\u000a<P><STRONG>Neg</STRONG>: Not feeling like I have any coping strategies anymore, I remember writing a list ages ago, but I don't know what happened to it. Nothing I am doing is working.</P>\u000a<P><STRONG>Pos</STRONG>: I am going to look at some factsheets, and make a bank of coping strategies tonight. It can be a project of types. I miss projects.</P>

VHey,<BR /><BR />It's okay to leave school if you have a plan. Would it be possibly to go to TAFE instead? It's probably not too late to get in to somewhere mid-year. <BR />Another option could be finishing next year? Sometimes just a different year level makes for an amazing difference. You could spread your subjects out so you're just doing a couple for the rest of this year, then the rest next year. Or you could look into even taking a 6 month break to take care of yourself, perhaps even make some money, then return or begin TAFE next year.

V<P>Hi All,</P>\u000a<P>&nbsp;Thank you so much for all of the helpful feedback !&nbsp; it means a lot that you\u2019re all taking the time to respond to me and make me feel important, so thank you.</P>\u000a<P>&nbsp;</P>\u000a<P>Understandably, I\u2019ve been thinking back to my visits to the councillor from high school and remembering what they were like, and I always remember leaving and feeling really vulnerable .. is this a normal thing? Should I expect this if I do decide to go back to one here as well? <BR /> </P>\u000a<P>I think I\u2019m a bit scared to get tangled up with a councillor again \u2013 it takes a lot of trust for me to be able to say all of this to someone\u2019s face and I don\u2019t like feeling so vulnerable &nbsp;.. I definitely think it has something to do with feeling like a part of me has to be \u201cfixed\u201d or \u201cchanged\u201d.... I feel like if I actually do find out what\u2019s going on (whether I fit neatly or not \u2013 thank you Sophie <img class="emoticon emoticon-smileyhappy" id="smileyhappy" src="http://inspire.i.lithium.com/i/smilies/16x16_smiley-happy.png" alt="Smiley Happy" title="Smiley Happy" /> ) I feel like I\u2019ll be losing a little part of me and I think that\u2019s what scaring me ... I feel like im going through this process more or less alone and I don\u2019t know how I\u2019ll feel about forcing myself to change or \u201cget better\u201d ... has anyone else felt like that? &nbsp;but considering everyone has really positive things to say about it, I am honestly considering working up the courage to go so thank you all for the push ..</P>\u000a<P>&nbsp;</P>\u000a<P>Thank you @Birdseye&nbsp;for the help about ways to avoid avoiding the councillor! Haha I really do appreciate those tips and If I decide that\u2019s what I want to do, I promise to be gutsy enough to tell them that I expect to try to avoid them! &nbsp;</P>\u000a<P><a href="http://forums.au.reachout.com/t5/user/viewprofilepage/user-id/2590">@Sophie</a>, I completely understand that he isn\u2019t really supposed to be trained in mental health, I guess it was just a bit of shock to build myself up that much to going and to him, it must have seemed like nothing ...</P>\u000a<P><BR /> so a psychologist could eventually (attempt) to diagnose me but cant prescribe medication? That\u2019s okay, im not very keen on going onto medication, im already on one type of tablet and im not happy to go on anymore without telling my parents \u2013 which is a whole other can of worms! <BR /> Thank you for the links about psychologists, If I go I\u2019ll be sure to ask about the different types of counselling and working out whats right for me \u2013 that was really helpful <img class="emoticon emoticon-smileyhappy" id="smileyhappy" src="http://inspire.i.lithium.com/i/smilies/16x16_smiley-happy.png" alt="Smiley Happy" title="Smiley Happy" />&nbsp;</P>\u000a<P>&nbsp;</P>\u000a<P>@Bee&nbsp;\u2013 see my Gp didn\u2019t even do that? He asked a lot of questions and was like \u201cso theres two options for people your age, these tablets or talking therapy\u201d and I was like \u201cim sorry, but what do I actually have?\u201d like he didn\u2019t even really explain how hed come to the conclusion I needed help ..</P>\u000a<P><BR /> I\u2019m glad yours was a little better! So have you followed through with your plans of going to counselling or still trying to find the right one?</P>\u000a<P>&nbsp;</P>\u000a<P>By your recommendation, I have contacted EHeadSpace \u2013 I sent them an email just before posting this, explaining my situation and asking for what the recommended \u201cnext step\u201d should or could be .. so thank you to everyone that recommended them, ive finally done that too..</P>\u000a<P>&nbsp;</P>\u000a<P><STRONG>I\u2019m sorry this is so long</STRONG>, and thank you so much to everyone that has taken time out of their own busy lives to help me with mine \u2013 you have no idea how much it truly means to me.</P>

VI'm so proud that you've been able to do that Bee! Calling is really really hard, and I can think of many times when I've not returned an important call out of hopes of them calling me back instead.<BR />In fact, I'm in a similar situation where I think I have to face facts and call one tomorrow since they didn't call today. Terrifying. <BR /><BR />I'm sure she's used to, or understanding of, people not being talkative or responsive on phones. And you did still say things!! That's great. You said enough to get an appointment made, and that is really the important part of this. <BR />Not just hanging up the phone and/or avoiding the phone is also a really great thing that you've done. <BR /><BR />These may feel like little things that we should be able to easily do, but they're challenges and it's okay that they're challenges. Someday we will be able to confidently call.

VWe're often told about how it's best to listen to our gut feelings. This often is the case, but if it's going into overdrive maybe a part of you is creating the bad feeling.<BR /><BR />Perhaps you could try to keep a relationship going for a while without really much/any real opening up. Talk to them about the trivial things, the things going on in your life at the moment such as something you just watched or read, also things that you've come across that you're interested in doing/seeing. <BR /><BR />You don't have to talk deeply with people for them to be friends.<BR />As you talk to them more generally you may find that they naturally open up and talk about more serious or deep issues, and that often really helps. We don't want to be the only person in the relationship putting personal parts about ourselves out there, and as long as we don't start that really early in the relationship (in my experience) that's not how it ends up.<BR /><BR />You can also have less contact with a person without having really pushed them away. You can not speak to someone for a couple of weeks, then every day for a few days. You can not really have contact for a month and then arrange to have a coffee together.<BR />Chances are they're not going to see this small lull as a reason to have given up on you as a friend or no longer be interested in you as a friend. They probably still think of you as a friend, just one they haven't spoken to very recently and would love to hear from.

V<P><STRONG>Neg</STRONG>: Things at home are overwhelming me today. I can't even type properly right now. Feeling so very overwhelmed so annoyed. Feeilng at the end of my tether</P>\u000a<P><STRONG>Pos</STRONG>: I'm aware that things are hitting my limit. I am working towards being open with my psych. I am giong to do some relaxation exercises tonight after this, really just try to calm. I'm tryig to focus on the youtube mix I'm listening to right now</P>\u000a<P>&nbsp;</P>\u000a<P><STRONG>Neg</STRONG>: Feeling like there is so much I just need to do right now. Right now there is so many things I want to do, but I'm not feeling well enough to really do any of it. So confused. There's so much I want to bring up with the psych, just to figure it all out, but I'm not even sure how to address it or where to start. What to do even.</P>\u000a<P><STRONG>Pos</STRONG>: I can take things one by one. I only need to go at a pace which I'm okay with. I will be able to be open with her in time. I've written a letter during the past week which I printed out today and plan on handing her tomorrow, that is after I show up!</P>\u000a<P>&nbsp;</P>\u000a<P><STRONG>Neg</STRONG>: Things at home got very heated today. and it's left me feeling so confused. So lost and annoyed. I'm sick of the same fights over money. As if money is everything. I just can't cope with that attitude of wanting champagne on a beer budget. I just can't keep living in a mixed world like this anymore...</P>\u000a<P><STRONG>Pos</STRONG>: I know I'm not to blame for what happened. I was just a bystander. I am allowed to feel whatever it is inside right now. I am working on my attiude to everything right now. I'm working on life.&nbsp;</P>\u000a<P>&nbsp;</P>\u000a<P><STRONG>Neg</STRONG>: I woke this morning with a pain in my chest, near the bottom of my rib-cage. I tried to just ignore it and sleep, but it's hung aronud a fair bit today. Not sure if it's asthma from al the smoke in the air right now, or something else.&nbsp;</P>\u000a<P><STRONG>Pos</STRONG>: I am watching it. I am taking all necesary precautions and monitoring the pain. Ensuring I'm &nbsp;breathing nice and deep and that the air is fresh!</P>\u000a<P>&nbsp;</P>\u000a<P><STRONG>Neg</STRONG>: Was late to work this morning. Found it kinda hard to get through my shift. I'm feeling so disappointed in myself, that I'm struggling to get through my 4.5 hours shifts, feeling like I'd rather be in bed.</P>\u000a<P><STRONG>Pos</STRONG>: Thankful I wasn't too late, and it was heaps busy either! SO there wasn't extra strain on colleagues. This something I NEED to bring up with the psych and GP and see what can be done. I'm struggling with the shifts because of my sleep cycle and also the excessive worrying and anxieties. I am trying to get these under control by seeing a pysch! It's a process.</P>\u000a<P>&nbsp;</P>\u000a<P><STRONG>Neg</STRONG>: Asked an old friend if there is any chance of patching things over between us, but not feeling like I CAN do that right now. Feeling like it is just too hard. Running into her at work on Friday made me remember all the things I didn't like about the relationship and why I didn't fight the friendship ending. I'm so confused.</P>\u000a<P><STRONG>Pos</STRONG>: I need to look after myself, and if right now that means that it take a few weeks to finally start to patch it over, than so be it. It also needs to be a two way street. At the moment the ball is in my court, but I'm having trouble throwing it. I think right now I need to talk this over with someone before diving in and making any deicisons where this is concerned. Right now I think I just need to take a breather and relax.</P>\u000a<P>&nbsp;</P>\u000a<P><STRONG>Neg</STRONG>: Feeling numb right now. There is nothing.</P>\u000a<P><STRONG>Pos</STRONG>: I am going to check my apple and backcurrent pie and afterwards have a bath to realx my body.</P>

There are tons around the country (part of the hearing voices network). It might be helpful to see if there us one in your area. I know it could be daunting but I'm pretty sure they would be as helpful and as friendly as the one I went to.

VI'm just glad I can offer any help <img class="emoticon emoticon-smileyhappy" id="smileyhappy" src="http://inspire.i.lithium.com/i/smilies/16x16_smiley-happy.png" alt="Smiley Happy" title="Smiley Happy" /><BR /><BR />What you were expecting is a bit more like what could happen at a psychologist or psychiatrist appointment. Usually the first session with one will be very much about getting to know you - so they'll ask about your family/living situation, they'll ask about what you do with your time (working/school) and ask you why you've come to see them. <BR />I remember doing some surveys with my psychologists, but I don't remember if they were in the first session, second session or way later ones. And I'm not sure how common practice it really is or if my surveys were more program specific. <BR /><BR />I'm pretty certain that a psychologist can give you a diagnosis (mine was by one), but if Sophie has other information I'd trust her to be right.<BR />However, do be aware that they may not be able to give you a diagnosis from the first session. This isn't anything about them compared to psychiatrists, it's just that sometimes it takes a bit more than one session for them to have certainty in any diagnosis or you may not even exactly fit a diagnosis. This isn't anything bad about you. It doesn't mean that you're not as bad as you others and not deserving/needing of help or that you're a really weird case. <BR />I'm pretty certain I was diagnosed in my first session, I just think it's important to be aware that it may take a bit longer.<BR /><BR />You're right about it largely being on you. But if you decide that you do want to continue to see a certain psychologist there are things that can help. Firstly, that we have to make appointments can help a lot with this. With my school it was much more of a dropping in whenever sort of deal than them actually expecting to see you at a certain time. If you miss an appointment rather than cancelling in my experience they'll make some sort of contact with you.<BR />When I cancelled appointments it would also  be brought up.<BR />I know several members also email their mental health professionals, so maybe that could be an option for you too. If you find someone you like you may want to mention this worry of avoiding and then not taking it upon yourself to reconnect again so they may be able to figure out some ways to lessen the likelihood. <BR /><BR />Yep, I get what you're saying. Reminding yourself that they want to help and that there's nothing they haven't heard before may help with that fear. They're not there to judge you, they just want to help you. <BR />If we think about it, it's more likely to work out than not going.

VHey <a href="http://forums.au.reachout.com/t5/user/viewprofilepage/user-id/238">@Bee</a> I'm sorry to hear you're having a rough time at the moment. Is it possible for your psych to fit you in earlier? Maybe in case there is a cancellation if they are fully booked? It might be worth looking into. <BR /><BR />I understand what you mean at work. Having to always be on focus and on task, it was always my weak point. And then having to have the customer repeat themselves because I wasn't listening. During the dead-quiet time, try cleaning up the area around the registers, organising things, wiping down the surfaces, organising any nearby shelves, to keep yourself occupied. It can be tough during the rushes, I've been stuck alone faced with what felt like an endless supply of customers but I know you're strong and brave and capable. <BR /><BR />I don't know if I'm helping you at all, but I want you to know I'm here for you. Even though I'm terrified of bees, you're the exception <img class="emoticon emoticon-smileyhappy" id="smileyhappy" src="http://inspire.i.lithium.com/i/smilies/16x16_smiley-happy.png" alt="Smiley Happy" title="Smiley Happy" />

All friendships (and relationships) begin with only knowing that person a day. Just talk to him more about his interests, get to know him so it you know him. Depending on the gathering, perhaps he is someone you could go out with to an event, someone you can trust. It doesn't have to be a romantic thing, you can tell him you want to get to know him first. <BR /><BR />I'm sorry I'm not the best at this, romance is a little beyond me but I hope I helped, and ReachOut has some factsheets that might help you, just search for Romance in the search bar and hopefully you'll find something of help to you.

I thought that because it was science and had research meant that it would eventually happen to me. As for the attraction problem I do not have a boyfriend and by all men I meant ALL men which would include my ex (obviously). If I had not read that article then I would not be enduring this mental storm at the moment.

VI would love if there is a GR on sexuality that focuses on discovering/discussing our own in a safe environment and talking about the lesser known sexualities. Things like asexuality, demisexuality, greysexuality, pansexuality and a touch on homo, hetero and bi although those are already very well known. <BR /><BR />
