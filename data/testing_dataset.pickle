I feel the pressure to 'act'. Whereas when I'm at home, I don't have to do this and I feel so much more comfortable as a result.<BR />I wonder whether this is normal to an extent, though. Many people do put on a bit of a mask at work or at school - who knows what they are like at home. But I feel like the way I feel is an exaggeration on the norm.<BR />I think I will talk to mum about it tonight, and bring it up in my next psychiatrist session.<BR />Thanks for the support. It's so much less isolating when other people come out and say they have/have had a similiar problem.&nbsp;<BR /><BR /></P>

VHey <a href="http://forums.au.reachout.com/t5/user/viewprofilepage/user-id/6930">@Cathy97</a> and welcome to ReachOut. <img class="emoticon emoticon-smileyhappy" id="smileyhappy" src="http://inspire.i.lithium.com/i/smilies/16x16_smiley-happy.png" alt="Smiley Happy" title="Smiley Happy" /><BR /><BR />You are definitely not alone in what you are feeling. I also struggle with social anxiety. Finding it difficult to be around people minus a select few and meet new people or make friends. <BR />A lot of people don't like to stray from what is considered 'normal' or 'correct' behaviours. So if you don't fit those parameters, then they won't like you. Not all people are like this, like your close friends and family, and I'm not even sure why they are. Society is so highly rooted in our lives, learning and culture it, and most of what it says and stands for, is considered true.<BR />I struggled a lot trying to fit into those norms, I've given up now, but I do remember the pressures of fitting in and being liked. <BR />The first thing to do is to not forget the people you have and accept and love you. Those are the people you want to keep in your life. <BR />When trying to fit it, it is important to be yourself, even if some people don't like it. I had a weekend with other students and I was completely myself (weirdness and all) and I ended up making an awesome friend. You might find someone who likes you for you, and if you hide that you'll miss them. When it's important to be yourself, you have to be sure not to be mean to others, intentionally or not. That's where I struggle, because I don't quite understand it, but if you think someone is offended apologise. So they know that it wasn't mean in the way they thought. <BR /><BR />It seems that you have a few close friends out there, do you think they or your family could help you too? Don't forget to talk about it with the psychiatrist, friends or family. Talking can help relieve some of the pressures and they might be able to help you out.<BR /><BR />N1ghtW1ng

VHey <a href="http://forums.au.reachout.com/t5/user/viewprofilepage/user-id/6899">@Aqui</a><BR /><BR />You mention that you're not really sure what person you'd like to be, and you mention that being appreciated is also very important to you. Perhaps a place to start would be to think of what you appreciate in other people, and what other people appreciate in other people? Maybe that may give you an idea on the sort of things you may like to try doing.<BR /><BR />As Safari93 said, it sounds like you're relying a lot on what other people think of you and equating their opinions on you with your worth a lot. I think it would be wonderful if you could try to think of your own beliefs a little bit more. Other people do not define you. <BR />What things do you like about yourself? What things do you think people should appreciate about you (even if you feel that right now they don't)? What good qualities would people you know say you have? Why do the people in your life keep you in your life? I guarantee that everyone isn't just keeping you around out of pity. You offer them all something.

If online isn't your thing, you could also try over the phone with the services mentioned above. <BR />If you are in a school or work environment chances are they'll have a counsellor available to you. <BR /><BR />It's so great that you've been able to tell your mum, even if it's not all of it, a little is still awesome. A lot of people struggle with telling their family, especially parents, so it's awesome you did.<BR /><BR />We'd love to hear how you go.

I feel like I have made some progress.</P>\u000a<P>I am in Year 12 at the moment but changed schools at the beginning of the year, to a sort of online school called Open Access, so that I can do my studies at home. I was so anxious at school I just couldn't concentrate on my work.</P>\u000a<P>I often feel very socially anxious and it's what I struggle most with. I find it hard to be my true self (except for with a few very close friends and my family) around people my age, or even people that are older or younger.&nbsp;</P>\u000a<P>I just have this thing that they wouldn't like me if I acted like I do when I'm at home. I feel the pressure to fit in and be cool and socially accepted. But it's exhausting doing this and leaves me feeling fake and blergh. The fact is I just don't feel comfortable around people. I get especially anxious meeting new people.</P>\u000a<P>Does anyone else feel like this or have had success with managing it?&nbsp;<img class="emoticon emoticon-smileysad" id="smileysad" src="http://inspire.i.lithium.com/i/smilies/16x16_smiley-sad.png" alt="Smiley Sad" title="Smiley Sad" /></P>\u000a<P>&nbsp;</P>

V<a href="http://forums.au.reachout.com/t5/user/viewprofilepage/user-id/1192">@ElleBelle</a> It wasn't so much a discussion, but at least I got some information across, which hopefully will help. <BR />It was good to be able to email it through and just get it out without having to try and juggle my words - I could reword things as often as I needed. - Which is something I do often when tying to explain this. (I think I've already reworded this about 5 times!) Which is why I find text a lot easier, I can see my words and re-read them, that's harder to do verbally.<BR /><BR />But we're trying to find a middle ground which suits us both. And I think having her say that I needed to think about HOW I could communicate things with her, even if it was via a text , helped a lot in being able to write and send that email.

V<P>Last night I told a male friend of mine I wanted to try ice 'the different way'. I have only ever smoked it on occasion usually when it was supplied for free, alcohol has always been my vice. However recently I found myself sliding deeper down the path of self destruction trying to feel something wether it was good or bad. My conscience and my whole body for that matter screamed at me not to allow him to &nbsp;but something inside me wanted the excitement and the vulgur dirty feeling of doing something bad. I won't lie the rush was quite euphoric but was it worth comprising my values and hating myself for the following 24hrs? The obvious answer is no. I feel ashamed and dirty. My dilemma lies in my complete ignorance for my true values to choose to do something that I know will damage me and I will regret. It is as if I am punishing myself or I have some kind of sick attraction to being screwed up. I spent the last 24hrs in hospital because my comedown was so self hating I feared what I may do if left alone with my thoughts. I recounted my same old sob story of an emotionally abusive relationship at 19 and my addiction to alcohol from the age of 14 and my father being an alcoholic and suffering from bipolar. The counsellor kept emphasing that I had to 'let it go'. It has dawned on me that my anxiety my depression and alcohol abuse have become my identity and a label to hide behind. I don't know anything else I am good at being a chaotic mess. It is a terrifying feeling to me to take the steps to recovery. After today I feel a little more excited than terrified to start addressing my issues discovering my real self and becoming someone I'm proud of. I am planning on attending my first AA meeting tomorrow morning so stand by for my progress.</P>

VHi there \U0001f60a <BR />I really related to your post and can empathise with feeling like your going nowhere or that you haven't accomplished enough. If I can give one piece of advice it is that you need to shop around for the right psychologist don't give up if you click with the first one. I think I went to about 3 before I found one I really loved. The fact that your going through a dark time and your brave enough to have reached out is an achievement in itself.

V<P>Hi sorry for the long title!...if it is long that is!</P>\u000a<P>&nbsp;</P>\u000a<P>Anyways I am pretty sure my friends are tired of hearing it so I figured I might as well talk about it on here and then...yeah. Also I realize this is Reachout.com for Australia but for some reason the US one isn't working and I want to get my thoughts out...</P>\u000a<P>&nbsp;</P>\u000a<P>Okay so I realize it is probably stupid and people have bigger problems...I mean I have bigger problems, but I don't really get emotionally attached to someone so this is weird for me.</P>\u000a<P>&nbsp;</P>\u000a<P>Actually Idk if I am emotionally attached quite yet but I could see myself eventually being in a relationship with them and I've been single for years - by choice, I may add - so you might see why this is weird for me.</P>\u000a<P>&nbsp;</P>\u000a<P>Okay so I meet this guy almost three weeks ago, we have hung out 3 times. The first night we meet and then the week following and then last week. Each time he has invited me to first hang out with him and his friends and then afterwards we go hangout together. This last time he was being extermly cute, like holding my hand in front of them and kissing me on the cheek and what not. Which I thought was weird because most guys aren't like that, we are in college btw, but I thought it was nice as well. Then later that night we went out with our different friends and then ran into each other at a party, where I got a little annoyed because I wanted to hang out but he wanted to go to the bars with his friends.&nbsp;</P>\u000a<P>&nbsp;</P>\u000a<P>Now first of all can I just say that I hate that the legal drinking age is 21 and that I am close, yet not close enough to it. Second of all, I realize its not fair of me to be mad at him for not ditching his friends for a girl he just started to hang out with, but I was drunk so at the time it seemed like a valid reason to be mad. Anyways later that night he apoligized and told me he enjoyed seeing me and looked forward to seeing me again.&nbsp;</P>\u000a<P>&nbsp;</P>\u000a<P>Here is the thing, he is either:</P>\u000a<P>a. The absolute worst texter in the world</P>\u000a<P>or</P>\u000a<P>b. Not into me enough to text me.</P>\u000a<P>&nbsp;</P>\u000a<P>I realize this seems stupid, but you have to admit in the current age texting is sort of a big way of communication. I personally don't like long texting conversations but quick how are you would be nice! Finally my friends convienced me to just text him and ask him to hang out because he hadn't texted me for 3 or 4 days. He then informed me that he was busy this week but was free on the weekend.&nbsp;</P>\u000a<P>&nbsp;</P>\u000a<P>Okay, I also realize finals are in 2 weeks so its crunch time. Also typing this all out has made me feel both a little crazy and a little better. It just that people always say that if a guy wants to see you then he will make time for you. So why isn't he making time for me? I mean yes for me its school, friends/family, work, and then boys but we could at least have cute study dates!</P>\u000a<P>&nbsp;</P>\u000a<P>I just don't enjoy feeling vulnerable or looking desperate. So if anyone has any advice please let me know.</P>\u000a<P>&nbsp;</P>\u000a<P>...Also sorry for the long post, at least you can enjoy the mind of a crazy girl.</P>

V<DIV class="usertext-body may-blank-within md-container ">\u000a<DIV class="md">\u000a<P>Its been almost a year and a half since i moved to Australia to pursue a masters degree. During all this time, i have made no friends at all. I mean i tried by best in keeping informal relationships with people and going above and beyond but no one ever follows up.</P>\u000a<P>&nbsp;</P>\u000a<P>My daily routine involves going to class, coming back, sleeping, cycling for 20 kms in the morning (40 kms on the weekends). Rinse, wash, repeat. I made a couple of acquaintances last year with a couple of people i was living with.</P>\u000a<P>I invite them to my place now and then to watch movies, and i try to be best to host them. I host wonderful dinner parties too with gourmet dishes (since i was previously have experience as a chef). They have a wonderful time, but after that they never seem to follow up. It's like i am always putting my foot forward for people, be it during group meetings for university or having people come over. I am almost never invited for that "drink" after class or that general hangout. In fact, i never been invited by anyone i know to do anything. I always take the initiative and recently i have become so apathetic about it. The only person i consider as a friend is female but i try so hard to make plans with her and its a hit and miss. I took her once for a concert on my expense, amongst other stuff. But even she doesn't follow up on how i am or what i am doing.</P>\u000a<P>I feel hopeless and i never seem to have the motivation to do anything. Even study. It's like i am living in a loop where i only hear myself in my head. I am generally a nice person, quite the extravert and can talk about anything. But most of my conversations with people have no effect. I keep analyzing myself to see what my discrepancies are. I always feel that i am making an effort to keep up a "social front" but nothing seems to work. I always keep reminding myself that "things will get better" and i always keep a cheerful and humorous attitude to the people i meet. But deep inside, i feel so empty.</P>\u000a<P>I spend my free time doing long distance cycling and often release all my aggression on those long bike rides. Besides that, i have absolutely no one i can rely on. I feel like screaming most of the time to just release the frustration, but i feel absolutely hopeless at the end of the day.</P>\u000a<P>&nbsp;</P>\u000a<P>Because of this, i even started smoking like a chimney and this adversely affects the only release that i have which is cycling. I often feel my chest burn up and i feel absolutely hopeless of the situation i am in at the moment. I seriously have no idea what to do, i am trying my best. What am i exactly doing wrong?</P>\u000a<P>&nbsp;</P>\u000a<P>I have recently become so apathetic about everything. I don't talk to my folks back home, my friends from my country don't follow up on me (most of the time i do, just to check up on them and see how they are doing and thats it). I feel like giving up and just keeping everything to myself. I am seriously worried of feeling absolutely numb about everything and i fear i am going to become devoid of any emotion if i keep threading on this course. I am seriously trying my best to manage. But what i am i missing? I really need the help and support otherwise i feel i am going to become apathetic.</P>\u000a</DIV>\u000a</DIV>

V<a href="http://forums.au.reachout.com/t5/user/viewprofilepage/user-id/6825">@moonwalk</a> oh... haha... believe me I tried 8 times or more on their web service because I can't call on the phone I just can't do it yet. What happened was they finally set me up with a counsellor, and I tried 3 times this weekend to contact this certain counsellor, but each time I got told to come back. So this morning I logged in as I was told to do, only to be told "come back later he's not here" ok I did that, half an hour later I logged in and they told me he wasn't coming in. This made me so so so angry because why didn't they just tell me? I tried talking to them about the situation and they kept telling me to leave. I logged in I think about 10 times, each time I got answered they told me to come back on Tuesday, which I have no doubt will result in me being told to come back another day. Ugh make me so angry. Eheadspace refuse to help me too, it's complicated but basically because I go to headspace in person now they are no longer supporting me even though I need it<BR /><BR /><BR /><a href="http://forums.au.reachout.com/t5/user/viewprofilepage/user-id/4683">@Creativegirl12</a> thanks!<BR /><BR />I'm over everything. I am just at my breaking point with dealing with everything all of the time, why does everything have to be so hard. Why can't I just be normal and cope with normal things instead of being so messed up.

VJust to add, I'm okay. I'm going to sleep it off in about half an hour. One of the drawbacks of being female is hormones going crazy, this is just that, or at least being helped along by that. I know,  mentally/intellectually that none of those things are true, or they're not as bad as I'm making them out to be, and I just need to relax, today was a big day, I did a lot. And things aren't on schedule like they should be. But it's all good, I'm getting a little overdramatic anyways thanks to reading fiction, after I finish off my list I really need to get my hands on a more lighthearted book. <BR />

VI struggle with inferiority complex. I always set high goals I never achieve. I compare myself to others. I strongly envy others who I think are better than me because they are successful. It's really bad to feel you don't fit in this world. I feel anxiety, depression, low self belief and hate. I don't feel appreciated and I'm tired of feeling I'm a failure

Casually duck your head at the right time so it's a slow movement but you still feel better for getting out of the way. And not screaming helps. <img class="emoticon emoticon-smileytongue" id="smileytongue" src="http://inspire.i.lithium.com/i/smilies/16x16_smiley-tongue.png" alt="Smiley Tongue" title="Smiley Tongue" />

VI'm a huge footy fan and a one-eyed Sydney Swans supporter. Needless to say, please don't talk about last year's Grand Final <img class="emoticon emoticon-smileytongue" id="smileytongue" src="http://inspire.i.lithium.com/i/smilies/16x16_smiley-tongue.png" alt="Smiley Tongue" title="Smiley Tongue" /><BR /><BR />Growing up my favourite player was Brett Kirk - at first because we share the same birthday but then because he was such an influential leader at the club. His story is one of determination and passion, which I admire. He wasn't afraid to be himself. At other clubs I have soft spots for Brent Harvey, Brett Deledio and Patrick Dangerfield. And <a href="http://forums.au.reachout.com/t5/user/viewprofilepage/user-id/5111">@j95</a> of course Goodesy is in my list too.<BR /><BR />I go to matches in Melbourne all the time! (The other week's GF rematch against the Hawks was BRILLIANT to be at <img class="emoticon emoticon-smileytongue" id="smileytongue" src="http://inspire.i.lithium.com/i/smilies/16x16_smiley-tongue.png" alt="Smiley Tongue" title="Smiley Tongue" />). When I was younger I was an Auskick kid who played footy at half-time, and I also won a competition where I got to run out onto the MCG with the players! Running through that banner is one of my happiest childhood memories <img class="emoticon emoticon-smileyvery-happy" id="smileyvery-happy" src="http://inspire.i.lithium.com/i/smilies/16x16_smiley-very-happy.png" alt="Smiley Very Happy" title="Smiley Very Happy" /><BR /><BR />Anyone else here a footy fan?

Saying that you want help is the first step. <img class="emoticon emoticon-smileyhappy" id="smileyhappy" src="http://inspire.i.lithium.com/i/smilies/16x16_smiley-happy.png" alt="Smiley Happy" title="Smiley Happy" />&nbsp;</P>\u000a<P>&nbsp;</P>\u000a<P>I just want to reinterate what&nbsp;<a href="http://forums.au.reachout.com/t5/user/viewprofilepage/user-id/5111">@j95</a>&nbsp;said in that seeking help online is just as valid as seeing someone in person. It can be pretty daunting talking about your emotions. I guess this is because when doing so, we are pretting much exposing ourselves in which we are in a vunerlable position. There are people out there that generally want to help and laying it all out on the table to someone who doesn't want to help can be quite discouraging. And I am just rambling here and probably went off track.</P>\u000a<P>&nbsp;</P>\u000a<P>I guess the best place to start if you are not into the whole online stuff is with your GP. Talking about all these things can be hard, like you said, so if you find it easier, just write down everything that you want to say. And then the GP should work with you on what is the best solution for you.</P>\u000a<P>&nbsp;</P>\u000a<P>There are many places you can seek help online such as <A href="https://www.eheadspace.org.au/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">eheadspace</A>, <A href="https://www.beyondblue.org.au/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">beyondblue</A>&nbsp;(1300 22 4636), and <A href="http://www.kidshelp.com.au/teens/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">kids helpline</A>&nbsp;(1800 55 1800). If you find yourself in a crisis situation, there is always <A href="https://www.lifeline.org.au/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">lifeline</A>&nbsp;(13 11 14). Remember that if it is an emergency to always use emergency services.</P>\u000a<P>&nbsp;</P>\u000a<P>If this all seems overwhelming, just take a deep breath and proceed when you are ready.</P>\u000a<P>&nbsp;</P>\u000a<P>Hope to see you around the RO community, we are a really supportive bunch!</P>\u000a<P>&nbsp;</P>\u000a<P>stonepixie</P>\u000a<P>&nbsp;</P>\u000a<P>P.S.

And its okay to feel down. <BR /><BR /> I agree with <a href="http://forums.au.reachout.com/t5/user/viewprofilepage/user-id/6911">@Elaine</a> it can take a while to find the right psychologist, even GP. I've struggled with finding the right supports, in fact, I'm still working on it. Its  okay to not connect to the first person. Remember with the right support you have the potential to achieve your goals. You have to keep fighting. I know you can do it <img class="emoticon emoticon-smileyhappy" id="smileyhappy" src="http://inspire.i.lithium.com/i/smilies/16x16_smiley-happy.png" alt="Smiley Happy" title="Smiley Happy" />

V<P><a href="http://forums.au.reachout.com/t5/user/viewprofilepage/user-id/5093">@stonepixie</a> well yes that is true. I often forget that. I didn't end up ringing the clinic today, I didn't have time, and the close before I finish work today. I have decided to just continue with the initial dose and go from there. It's also the same dose as&nbsp;written on my&nbsp;referral for the psychiatrist....</P>\u000a<P>&nbsp;</P>\u000a<P>&nbsp;</P>\u000a<P><STRONG>Neg</STRONG>: Looking through my book and realising I didn't write down any notes for my focus children this last week just gone! <img class="emoticon emoticon-smileysurprised" id="smileysurprised" src="http://inspire.i.lithium.com/i/smilies/16x16_smiley-surprised.png" alt="Smiley Surprised" title="Smiley Surprised" /> uho. I don't even know what they did when they were present! Oops.</P>\u000a<P><STRONG>Pos</STRONG>: I have some photos, I have an analysis of the experience I ran. I can make something from that I guess.</P>\u000a<P>&nbsp;</P>\u000a<P><STRONG>Neg</STRONG>: I get so far than I crash and feel so unmotivated and&nbsp;procrastination strikes. I then doubt myself and my ability to get anything done.. I dislike feeling like this.</P>\u000a<P><STRONG>Pos</STRONG>: I'm getting things done. I'm slowly crossing them all off my to-do list. I've been a bit more motivated today after going to work. I don't know why but it's had that effect on me today! I know the doubt is a symptom of the illness trying to roar it's ugly head, I've been too awesome for it this morning.</P>\u000a<P>&nbsp;</P>\u000a<P><STRONG>Neg</STRONG>: Part of me is still questioning if the GP was right in thinking that hospital was the best place for me right now...</P>\u000a<P><STRONG>Pos</STRONG>: What she doesn't know is how I CAN cope with things outisde of appointments etc. What I've struggled to convey is HOW I manage to get through. What I haven't managed to convey, is that despite the terrible thoughts inside my head, I don't actually want to act upon them. I don't. What I struggle to admit is that, despite being so tired and lacking in energy etc, I look forward to work. It's something I am actually enjoying! I love the interaction with customers, I enjoy beig able to run between different tasks at work. I enjoy that I'm working individually but also apart of a biger team running a company. </P>\u000a<P>&nbsp;</P>\u000a<P><STRONG>Neg</STRONG>: I'm often getting too caught up in everything to focus on what I want. I get too caught up in the negative to focus or function. And mostly this is in my apts with health professionals, and it's when the anxiety and fear totally take control, partly because it's easier to let them, but partly because I don't want to face facts.</P>\u000a<P><STRONG>Pos</STRONG>: I'm working towards all of this. I'm working on moving past the negative thoughts, and not letting them control me. It's just a slow process, which isn't always successful for me. I'm working on being able to talk with my health professionals. It's not something I'm very familiar with - talking alloud about this stuff, so it's going to be hard and frustrating at times.</P>\u000a<P>&nbsp;</P>\u000a<P><STRONG>Neg</STRONG>: I feel like my motivation for today has disappeared. I'm feeling like I can't achieve anything more today in terms of my assessments. I'm feeling at limit right now.</P>\u000a<P><STRONG>Pos</STRONG>: I've recognised this. I'm going to take a break and come back to it later, so I don't end up digging myself into a hole again. </P>\u000a<P>&nbsp;</P>\u000a<P><STRONG>Neg</STRONG>: It was a rather short study stint, and I don't feel like I've really achieved much.</P>\u000a<P><STRONG>Pos</STRONG>: It was short, but productive. I've got my reflections finished! I got my practice review finished! I have finished one whole word doc to send through! My todo list is shrinking!&nbsp; I need to remember that looking after me sometimes means shorter study sessions. And that's totally okay!</P>

I'm  out of depression now. Apart from depression being more intense, my mood swings have become more rapid, and since they are continuous too, I'm going up and down a lot.

The people I've talked to say that they too don't feel the same in every situation and this is normal to an extent - for example, there is a "home" version of themselves and a "work" version of themselves - but this doesn't seem to play on their mind like it does for me. I guess for me it feels unnatural and fake, so I'm probably at the extreme end at the moment. It especially doesn't help that I have totally outgrown the group of friends I have at the moment and we no longer have anything in common. <BR />I often feel self-conscious socially&nbsp;<a href="http://forums.au.reachout.com/t5/user/viewprofilepage/user-id/4683">@Creativegirl12</a>&nbsp;<img class="emoticon emoticon-smileysad" id="smileysad" src="http://inspire.i.lithium.com/i/smilies/16x16_smiley-sad.png" alt="Smiley Sad" title="Smiley Sad" />&nbsp;Sometimes I feel like my progress is so slow and that I am at a standstill and I wonder whether I could ever recover completely. Others do it though. I guess it's just important to keep going.<BR />Thanks a lot for the comments everyone.&nbsp;<BR />&nbsp;</P>

Maybe I need to get a medication adjustment. <BR /><BR />Sometimes I just feel really alone. It's like nobody really understands what I go through. Sometimes I feel like I need more support, because I find it hard to get through the day a lot of the time. I feel pathetic and needy.

It's just one huge stress cloud above my head which only grows as I work through it! <img class="emoticon emoticon-smileysurprised" id="smileysurprised" src="http://inspire.i.lithium.com/i/smilies/16x16_smiley-surprised.png" alt="Smiley Surprised" title="Smiley Surprised" /></P>\u000a<P>Pos: I'm slowly working through it. I will do my best. At the end it's all I can do.</P>\u000a<P>&nbsp;</P>\u000a<P>Neg: I've been chatting with an old high school friend and I'm starting to see why I didn't fight the friendship ending. I'm just feeling really judged and made to feel insignificant. I'm not feeling like I have a say in what I do at all. I'm realy wanting to just be free from all the drama. On one hand I want t patch things up, bu on the other, there is too much history and I don't want that in my life anymore. I don't think I'm ready to have a friendship with her.</P>\u000a<P>Pos: I can get through this. I am not going to reply anymore on the topic, and say I've got study to do and am doing it.</P>\u000a<P>I also need to see that she's changed. Our friendship was bad on both sides, and I know that part of me not wanting to resume or create a new friendship is because I haven't fully moved on or changed like I want to. I'm very much in a ccle right now of needing to be there for me, and not needing any pressure from others. And I feel like I just can't give anything to anyone right now.</P>\u000a<P>&nbsp;</P>\u000a<P>Neg: I'm kinda feeling a bit guilty because I've not done as much as I want, but I'm feeling so exhausted at the same time. Gah. <img class="emoticon emoticon-smileysad" id="smileysad" src="http://inspire.i.lithium.com/i/smilies/16x16_smiley-sad.png" alt="Smiley Sad" title="Smiley Sad" /></P>\u000a<P>Pos: I'll live. I'm going to email my teacher and clarify when it's all due. I'm lost in it all.</P>

It can be a rather confusing time when you start to seek help, but whether you realise it or not, you are making amazing progress! <img class="emoticon emoticon-smileyhappy" id="smileyhappy" src="http://inspire.i.lithium.com/i/smilies/16x16_smiley-happy.png" alt="Smiley Happy" title="Smiley Happy" /><BR /><BR />Anything you are unsure of, you should just ask your GP to clarify.<BR /><BR />Letting people in is awesome! If it is any constellation, it took me a month after my first appointment before I could even talk about my diagnosis with anyone, including my parents.

VThank you! I've haven't tried ReachOut USA, but I've found it helpful here. I feel unworthy because I think I'm not important and I think I'm not important because I don't feel appreciated. I always think "I should be this or do this, so I can feel appreciated". I'm tired of being who I am. My ideal self is far from the person I feel I am. I feel like giving up. Maybe there's been an improvement in the last couple of years, but I still feel like struggling with low self belief. I just end up feeling unworthy at the end of the day because I don't feel as appreciated as I want.

Very helpful and applicable to my situation.<BR />Im scared of a lot  of things and believe or fight with feelings about what is because I cant comprehend them if that makes sense. My ocd when i try and get away from it feel like if i don't  do a ritual it'll  all pile up and ill lose control that's why im scared to reduce it. IT owns me.

There's not enough hours in a day. Im too old for kids line and head space but I think there are some other places like beyond blue.<BR />My 4 year old is under so many specialists that I feel like im going to lose my job running around with him so i come last if at all. But its at breaking point and something has got to give so I really need a rocket up my butt and somehow snap out of this! Its ruining my life!

V<P><STRONG>Neg</STRONG>: The GP ran rather late today. After that I struggled to communicate with her, which lead her to suggest going to hospital, which I refused. I felt so scared. So unsure. She brought in a senior GP in the practice... He managed to get me to talk! Feeling very out of it tonight. Didn't get anything at prac don today. Feeling so lost. Feeling so stuck. Feeling so unsure of life. I just want to hide.</P>\u000a<P><STRONG>Pos</STRONG>: I know she only did her best.&nbsp;suggesting hospital was probs the only way she could think of to keep me safe&nbsp;with the details she had at that moment. She called the senior GP in to help, which he did.</P>\u000a<P>&nbsp;</P>\u000a<P><STRONG>Neg</STRONG>: They took my blood pressure which was high. "why is it so high?" 'because of the anxiety.'&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He also said that the lack of improvement in 2 weeks wasn't much to be worried about, that some of what I had said was a side effect... There was talk about upping the dosage, but I have no clue what I'm meant to be doing anymore.</P>\u000a<P><STRONG>Pos</STRONG>: He said my BP was high because of the anxiety I was experiencing at that moment. It's not something to worry about. I am meant to see my gp on Wednesday, but so far don't have an apt. Maybe I can ring tomorrow during my break?</P>\u000a<P>&nbsp;</P>\u000a<P><STRONG>Neg</STRONG>: The gp referred me&nbsp; to a psychiatrist who happens to be more than 6hours drive away. I don't know if it's going to be a video link apt or what. I know nothing. I don't know if I'm meant to be upping my dose, or what I'm doing. I don't know what I'm doing at all.... I also wasn't given an apt for Wednesday. Nor was I told anything. Gah. I just want to give up already. It's all to fucking hard.</P>\u000a<P><STRONG>Pos</STRONG>: I don't know what to do.

At the moment I'm  relying on pain pills, sleeping pills, anti depressents and weight pills and anything else that makes me feel calm or productive.<BR />When im too out of it to feel much the anxiety eases and its when i feel most normal -<BR />My biggest things are:<BR />Ocd<BR />Finances<BR />My Mum (again I'm a huge warrior and I hate things I can't control) her health frazzles me!

Ive come to realize im either flat or emotional or stressed high strung resulting in a high level of rituals..i wonder sometimes if im bipolar. I feel so ungrateful for the wonderful things I have and to live in a wonderful country but then i dont like things that dont add up..like losing people. There is so much I need to come to terms with even though i dont think i do.

I was in the same scenario about a year ago, to help me recover I wore rubber bands so when ever I got an urge I could snap it on my wrist, or I would hold and ice cube in my hand and let the water run down my arm, you could also draw lines and if you wanted to or you could write things your grateful for or everyone you love on your arm also, just know that you're worth it (: and you WILL make it through this battle, and when your recovered you can share your wisdom and experiences to help others cope (:

V<P>Hi, <BR />I have looked at a few forums but this is my first time writing something, I am in need of advice, I have been on anti depressants now for four years for major depression and anxiety. I started on&nbsp; for 2 years and have since tried others currently on . My problem is I am looking for a good doctor that actually cares about mental health and not just someone who just fills out a script. I don't get any positive or worth while advice or conversations from my doctors regarding anti depressants. I feel worse everyday, my anxiety is thru the roof and all my doctor does is give my another one try getting very sick of it all. I have seen a counsellor and she has been great but I can't live with her full time!! <BR />So long story short does any know or is currently seeing a really good doctor on the Sunshine Coast?. I am currently in Maleny but I do not mind travelling for good help. <BR />Any advice a greatly appreciated thanks.</P>

Hope you don't mind!</P>\u000a<P>&nbsp;</P>\u000a<P>That is a long time to have been struggling but it is great that you have already seen a doctor and a counsellor. It is also good that you have identified that your treatment could progress even further and that you feel able to take charge of that. Go you! Have you discussed this with your GP? Have you requested a referral for a specialist or even behavioural therapy?</P>\u000a<P>&nbsp;</P>\u000a<P>If you haven't already, have a look at&nbsp;<A href="https://www.beyondblue.org.au/" target="_self" rel="nofollow">beyondblue</A> or&nbsp;<A href="http://www.blackdoginstitute.org.au/" target="_self" rel="nofollow">black dog</A> and check out&nbsp;<A href="http://au.reachout.com/self-help-strategies-for-depression" target="_self" rel="nofollow">these self-help strategies</A>. I know that regular activity can help lift one's mood too, it won't be the only answer but it can be part of the overall solution. Is there an activity that you enjoy?

V<P>Hi <a href="http://forums.au.reachout.com/t5/user/viewprofilepage/user-id/5125">@Dark Energy</a>, it is really worrying that you are rationalising some rather negative thoughts. How did you find the sheet that&nbsp;<a href="http://forums.au.reachout.com/t5/user/viewprofilepage/user-id/52">@Sophie-RO</a> suggested on challenging negative thinking? It is clear from your posts that you are&nbsp;a deep thinker, intelligent and articulate, and the challenging questions from that sheet stand out as being something you could complete.</P>\u000a<P>&nbsp;</P>\u000a<P>No one should have to feel the sadness you are feeling, but know that you are not alone with your pain. It is great that you have turned to us, now keep going \u2013 is there someone you trust that you could get together with? Can you talk to your father about how the fight made you feel? Or could you write about your thoughts and feelings? Remember also to write about the things in your life that you value and appreciate, no matter how small they may seem to you.</P>\u000a<P>&nbsp;</P>\u000a<P>Please do give the Suicide Call Back Service a try. Like Sophie said, they can help you build up your ways of coping.</P>

VYeah my mates band and I'm just supporting for some of their gigs. Spending a couple of days in each place. <BR /><BR />Would love to do an all round trip like take months and months off and do it as a road trip, do some backpacking work along the way to earn some money would be nice. At least then you can see lots of everything, I have loved this but you don't get to see everything of each place, still awesome though!<BR /><BR />I thought Margaret river was so cool! Reminded me a bit of Lorne, not sure why, but it was awesome! <BR /><BR />Free wifi is the best\u270c\U0001f3fd<BR /><BR />

What's 1 thing you're looking froward to? *cough cough*fro?*cough*<BR />I'm looking forward to... holidays!!<BR />4. Tell us about an awkward moment that happened to you or a friend.<BR />Well... which one to choose from? I suppose one slightly awkward moment was when I kind of pushed my friend onto the road... I somewhat misjudged the speed of the car and the length of time it would take to reach us and prompted her to cross at the wrong time... whoops! <img class="emoticon emoticon-smileytongue" id="smileytongue" src="http://inspire.i.lithium.com/i/smilies/16x16_smiley-tongue.png" alt="Smiley Tongue" title="Smiley Tongue" /><BR />5.

I think we've alll learnt some really valuable things here tonight, but for me the most important&nbsp;thing is that sex, sexuality and gender diversity is a personal journey and everyone's opinion is valid, no matter what it might be. We can all work together to make sure that acceptance increases in society, and that we can be a big part of that.&nbsp;</P>

V<a href="http://forums.au.reachout.com/t5/user/viewprofilepage/user-id/6878">@Kit</a> oh this book series is a rollercoaster. Maze Runner series, I'm onto the prequel book now. I doubt I'll read it again, I don't like the third person it's written it. It feels like first person, but in third. I'm gunning to read most of the books on my Kindle before asking for more. (So a month <img class="emoticon emoticon-smileytongue" id="smileytongue" src="http://inspire.i.lithium.com/i/smilies/16x16_smiley-tongue.png" alt="Smiley Tongue" title="Smiley Tongue" />)<BR /><BR />I feel... all over the place. I almost broke down crying this afternoon because of my feet and shoes. (Seriously though, I weat two different sizes, check the size of my feet and it says I'm 6, try on those size shoes and they're too small. Ugh.) But I bought myself a cornetto to make up for it. I also spoke to two different shop assissants asking a question so that was awesome for me.<BR />But... The problem is most of thetime I feel physically, mentally and emotionally drained. I don't want to do anything, at all. At the same time I want to read, go walking, eat, sleep, sometimes cry or throw a fit.<BR /><BR />The worst part is... I don't know who is me. I read so much, absorb myself into my books, my stories, shows, picking bits and pieces of different personalities and making them mine. I get so confuses because I'm scared of the dark but love darkness. I don't want to be alone but I love being by myself. For everything I hate, I love it(or an aspect of it) and it confuses me.<BR />I'm assertive, stubborn, but I let other people do want they want to do. I just... nothing is set. My pereonality changes but I suppose that is normal. Of course people change their likes, dislikes. Grow, adapt, evolve, change. It just feels like it's only me like this, who is changing without loosing the previous part so I'm left with the two me's. I doubt that made sense, but it feels good to say, or type, it.

A recent discovery is that I am terrible at shopping, for shoes specifically. <BR />3. I am always sick. Mainly nose and throat.<BR />4. I want to cry whenever I hear someone say they like a terrible adaption movie (Percy Jackson, Last Airbender, Eragon and so on)<BR />5. I like to stand or sit or lie and do literally nothing.

But I told my supervisor I wasn't having the best day and she was understanding..<BR />I've never really known fully what I want to do, and I'm unsure if me feeling like I'm in the wrong field is the combination of struggling with mental illness and the medication and stress causing me to think like that, or if it's actually for real what I want. Hopefully talking to them will give me some direction. Especially since my teacher has known me for quite a few years now....

V<P>Hi <a href="http://forums.au.reachout.com/t5/user/viewprofilepage/user-id/6932">@madlib</a> and welcome to ReachOut. It is hard to speak up when you're feeling this way, so well done on starting a conversation about how you're doing.</P>\u000a<P>&nbsp;</P>\u000a<P>It is certainly difficult when you put in so much effort to making new friends and growing a new support network without the desired results. No wonder you are feeling exhausted! Those dinner parties sound incredible, and you're doing this all while juggling a Masters, a new life, and a very active passion! You should be proud of everything you are achieving.</P>\u000a<P>&nbsp;</P>\u000a<P>I do know those feelings of exhaustion and frustration well and can assure you that you are not alone in just wanting something\u2014anything\u2014back. You sound like a caring person, genuine in your interest and generous with your time. They are wonderful traits to have and again, you should feel proud to offer this to others while you are working so hard yourself. Also know that sometimes we can experience feelings of isolation in spite of close friend and family networks.</P>\u000a<P>&nbsp;</P>\u000a<P>When dealing with feelings of isolation I find it helpful to focus on my favourite activities; it's a kind of self care that helps reframe priorities. Cycling sounds like it is your release, as you said, and it could be helpful to keep this up while you are still getting through this. There's a bit more about dealing with loneliness <A href="http://au.reachout.com/i-feel-so-alone" target="_self" rel="nofollow">here</A> and some tips on making friends <A href="http://au.reachout.com/how-to-make-friends" target="_self" rel="nofollow">here</A>.</P>\u000a<P>&nbsp;</P>\u000a<P>Good on you for reaching out and please do keep us updated with how you are doing. You will always have support here.</P>

VHey <a href="http://forums.au.reachout.com/t5/user/viewprofilepage/user-id/6897">@WonderGirl</a><BR /><BR />Have his texting habits always been the same? <BR />When you do text, does he text back in a way that allows for conversation or very blunt short answers to your questions without any attempt at continuing the conversation?<BR />Some people really don't like texting. Some people don't have time or credit to really text much. Maybe the way you two communicate is a thing to bring up when you next see him?<BR /><BR />It sounds to me like he does want to see you, and that he is making time for you. I get this primarily from telling you that he was free on the weekend. If someone doesn't want to see someone then they won't tell them when they're next free.

VOne of the things I do with people to overcome the putting others before ourselves barrier is to think of what they'd do with their problem if  it were someone else. For example if my father doesn't want to go to the doctor for something I'll ask him if he'd make me go for it, more often than not the answer is yes. <BR />Having to think of yourself as someone you care about, or through the eyes of someone you care about can be a good motivator to do something.

VHey, you said "I want to seek real help instead of hiding and speaking online to get help" if you've already had contact with them then just ignore my advice. But last year when I was in regular contact with eheadspace they helped me set up regular face to face appointment, so in fact its all hiding if you dont want it to be. When you log on you could tell them you'd like to go face to face but not sure how to go about it. They are really great, I had some issues with refusing to go to face to face but they were my problems, but when i finally agreed to it they were super helpful, they sent all my information over to the headspace centre, had a chat to them and even gave me a ring after my first appointment! <BR />
